c04-144-00.jpg	Say Granada TV , the producers : " We decided to make
c04-144-01.jpg	the switch because of the topicality of African
c04-144-02.jpg	affairs . The Wesker interview will be seen at a later
c04-144-03.jpg	date . " ACTOR Tom Courtenay was an outstanding
c04-144-04.jpg	success last night in ITV's " Private Potter , " his
c04-144-05.jpg	first big TV part . The play was a brilliantly-written
c04-144-06.jpg	essay on soldiering which stated that a fighting
c04-144-07.jpg	man could only be regarded as a machine .
c04-150-00.jpg	Potter screamed during an action , and was arrested . He
c04-150-01.jpg	claimed he had seen a vision of God - only the padre and his
c04-150-02.jpg	CO believed him . Courtenay played the part with a gawky ,
c04-150-03.jpg	Northern defiance . The cameras played continuously on his
c04-150-04.jpg	craggy face , and obstinate , baffled eyes . They stripped
c04-150-05.jpg	him of his ugly battle-dress , to leave him for
c04-150-06.jpg	what he was - Potter , a frightened boy who had a
c04-150-07.jpg	vision .
c04-165-00.jpg	The film replaced " What's My Line ? " and " Be My
c04-165-01.jpg	Guest " programmes because of an electricians'
c04-165-02.jpg	strike . It showed Britain today through the eyes
c04-165-03.jpg	of an American TV reporter , Eric Sevareid , and
c04-165-04.jpg	British personalities . Among them - Professor
c04-165-05.jpg	Dennis Brogan , Shelagh Delaney , and Alan Sillitoe .
c04-165-06.jpg	The film covered a wide aspect of the British
c04-165-07.jpg	scene , ranging from pubs , the Eton wall game ,
c04-165-08.jpg	to the European Common Market .
c04-170-00.jpg	Shelagh Delaney and Alan Sillitoe attacked
c04-170-01.jpg	education . It was left to reporter Sevareid
c04-170-02.jpg	to make the strongest criticisms . He said
c04-170-03.jpg	that in the race of the modern nations ,
c04-170-04.jpg	Britain was slipping behind ... .
c06-011-00.jpg	ALSO present is a London journalist who
c06-011-01.jpg	arrived two hours earlier by appointment
c06-011-02.jpg	to talk to the author of Borstal Boy and
c06-011-03.jpg	The Hostage about his new work , if any ,
c06-011-04.jpg	and who is now being pluckily convivial
c06-011-05.jpg	to fight off the frustration . The telephone
c06-011-06.jpg	has rung a couple of times , calls from
c06-011-07.jpg	other chums sniffing the wind and
c06-011-08.jpg	offering to drop by for a chat .
d01-016-00.jpg	The second said that the problems which arise from the comparisons with
d01-016-01.jpg	the Synoptics can be reasonably solved by paying due regard to the time and
d01-016-02.jpg	plan and to the different public for which , or against which , the author wrote .
d01-016-03.jpg	The third article excluded any allegorical interpretation of the Gospel .
d01-019-00.jpg	There is a whole group of theories which attempt to explain the problems of the
d01-019-01.jpg	Fourth Gospel by explanations based on assumed textual dislocations . The
d01-019-02.jpg	present state of the Gospel is the result of an accident-prone history . The
d01-019-03.jpg	original was written on a roll , or codex , which fell into disorder or was
d01-019-04.jpg	accidentally damaged . An editor , who was not the author , made what he
d01-019-05.jpg	could of the chaos by placing the fragments , or sheets , or pages , in order .
d01-049-00.jpg	The one real weakness of the Commentator's
d01-049-01.jpg	case is that , in common with all his colleagues ,
d01-049-02.jpg	he has not , until now , been able to exhibit exactly
d01-049-03.jpg	how this enlargement was effected nor has he
d01-049-04.jpg	been able to explain the textual movements by
d01-049-05.jpg	showing that such changes are part of a
d01-049-06.jpg	simple and coherent plan . To understand how
d01-049-07.jpg	this is possible it is necessary to examine the
d01-049-08.jpg	text of the Gospel .
d01-052-00.jpg	THE Fourth Gospel was almost certainly
d01-052-01.jpg	written in Greek . A modern text of the
d01-052-02.jpg	Gospel represents the work of generations of
d01-052-03.jpg	scholars who have compared the many manu-
d01-052-04.jpg	scripts of John and worked out the version
d01-052-05.jpg	which is most likely to have been the original
d01-052-06.jpg	wording . It is not possible to establish any one
d01-052-07.jpg	text with absolute precision .
d01-080-00.jpg	The bar was the commonest marking , but others
d01-080-01.jpg	were also used . Dots sometimes served in place of the
d01-080-02.jpg	bar , and there are cases where spacing is used as
d01-080-03.jpg	it is now used to mark a paragraph ending . Frequently
d01-080-04.jpg	paragraphos markings were omitted . C. H. Roberts is of
d01-080-05.jpg	the opinion that in the original of the Fourth Gospel
d01-080-06.jpg	some markings would be used , although which , it is
d01-080-07.jpg	impossible to say .
d01-085-00.jpg	Professor E. G. Turner is inclined to take the view that
d01-085-01.jpg	the original of the Gospel would be unmarked . The
d01-085-02.jpg	original of the Gospel , whether written on a roll or codex ,
d01-085-03.jpg	whether paragraphed or not , would be laid out in
d01-085-04.jpg	columns . This is the invariable practice of ancient
d01-085-05.jpg	manuscripts . A common size of column would hold
d01-085-06.jpg	about one third of a page of Souter's print .
d01-098-00.jpg	The edge of this sheet was attached to a wooden dowel
d01-098-01.jpg	and the sheet wound round this central pin . The roll made
d01-098-02.jpg	a simple and serviceable book . It was robust - the number
d01-098-03.jpg	which have survived the centuries is ample evidence of
d01-098-04.jpg	this - and it was easily stored . It had two disadvantages . It
d01-098-05.jpg	was generally a single-sided form of book , and it was not
d01-098-06.jpg	an easy form of book in which to find a
d01-098-07.jpg	reference .
d01-104-00.jpg	This last objection might have had some weight in
d01-104-01.jpg	ecclesiastical circles . In his Natural History , 13 . 11-12 ,
d01-104-02.jpg	the elder Pliny tells of the use of papyrus in roll-making .
d01-104-03.jpg	As Pliny was killed in the eruption of Vesuvius which
d01-104-04.jpg	overwhelmed Herculaneum and Pompeii in A.D. 79 , his
d01-104-05.jpg	information is contemporaneous with the New Testament .
d01-104-06.jpg	The other form of book was the codex . In this the
d01-104-07.jpg	sheets were bound together down one edge much as
d01-104-08.jpg	they are in modern books .
d01-118-00.jpg	Against these advantages the codex was fragile and
d01-118-01.jpg	might be bulky . It is sometimes possible to tell
d01-118-02.jpg	whether or not a particular text was written on
d01-118-03.jpg	a roll or a codex . Rolls were prepared for
d01-118-04.jpg	writing , but any papyrus left unused at the
d01-118-05.jpg	end could be cut off . If the text was longer than
d01-118-06.jpg	the roll , a sheet could easily be glued on .
d01-123-00.jpg	The verso of the roll was blank , and one
d01-123-01.jpg	cannot think of an author , Mark for example ,
d01-123-02.jpg	sending out his Gospel lacking the ending ,
d01-123-03.jpg	while one whole side of his roll was unused .
d01-123-04.jpg	The codex form was not so accommodating . Even
d01-123-05.jpg	in the case of the single-sheet quire , an extra
d01-123-06.jpg	sheet glued on might have to be gummed on
d01-123-07.jpg	over the binding , or the whole codex rebound .
d03-117-00.jpg	A natural transition from gardens and
d03-117-01.jpg	orchards to the vital question of water
d03-117-02.jpg	supply . The pools are probably natural springs
d03-117-03.jpg	enlarged to become reservoirs or cisterns in
d03-117-04.jpg	the rock . King Mesha of Moab boasts of their
d03-117-05.jpg	construction in lines 9 , 23-25 of the Moabite Stone ,
d03-117-06.jpg	which read : And I built Baal-meon and made
d03-117-07.jpg	in it the reservoir ... and I made both the
d03-117-08.jpg	reservoirs for water inside the town .
d04-012-00.jpg	The word Shamir was used as a
d04-012-01.jpg	personal name ( Git. 68a ) . The Hebrew
d04-012-02.jpg	word " SHAMIR " means guarded or preser-
d04-012-03.jpg	ved . Therefore , the real man , who
d04-012-04.jpg	regards himself as insignificant , as the
d04-012-05.jpg	prayer says : " What am I ? A worm " , he
d04-012-06.jpg	is the Shamir and such a man fulfils
d04-012-07.jpg	the Shmah , loves the Lord God with
d04-012-08.jpg	all his heart , and with all his soul and
d04-012-09.jpg	with all his might and studies the
d04-012-10.jpg	word of God .
d04-016-00.jpg	This man is the worm , the creature that
d04-016-01.jpg	cuts and polishes Altar-Stones . Such
d04-016-02.jpg	a man is the Shamir that guards him-
d04-016-03.jpg	self against all the irrelevant pleasures .
d04-016-04.jpg	Such a Shamir possesses the real acid
d04-016-05.jpg	to mould our character , to melt our
d04-016-06.jpg	heart of stone . This Shamir helps
d04-016-07.jpg	us earthly creatures to build an Altar
d04-016-08.jpg	for God to come nearer to God .
d04-021-00.jpg	The action of the Shamir writes books and their
d04-021-01.jpg	books are readable . This Shamir is indeed a rare
d04-021-02.jpg	diamond that incises the hardest rock , the hardest
d04-021-03.jpg	facts . And these creatures existed from the
d04-021-04.jpg	beginning . It is " the stone , which the builders
d04-021-05.jpg	refused , but it is to become the head-stone
d04-021-06.jpg	of the corner " . ( Ps. 118 , 22 . ) And the stone shall
d04-021-07.jpg	tell !
d04-028-00.jpg	" For the stone shall cry out of the wall " , like
d04-028-01.jpg	Baalam's ass , " and the purlin of timber shall
d04-028-02.jpg	creak in answer " " if the roof of our security is
d04-028-03.jpg	crushing our soul " ( see Hab. 2 , 10-11 ) . And it is
d04-028-04.jpg	through the Shamir : " That the earth shall be
d04-028-05.jpg	filled with the knowledge of the Glory of the
d04-028-06.jpg	Lord , as the waters cover the sea . " ( Hab. 2 , 14 . )
d04-032-00.jpg	The Shamir's daily life writes the Decalogue ,
d04-032-01.jpg	which is written on two plates , the hard facts
d04-032-02.jpg	of life , and all facts are " one " . We have all
d04-032-03.jpg	come across human Shamirs and they leave
d04-032-04.jpg	a deep impression on our feelings and senses .
d04-032-05.jpg	They make us the Altar for God to emit
d04-032-06.jpg	the Light which can be read in every
d04-032-07.jpg	language . The Shamir is the " seventh " and
d04-032-08.jpg	most important creature , that was created on
d04-032-09.jpg	the eve of the Sabbath , to bring the
d04-032-10.jpg	Sabbath , real peace to the whole world .
d04-037-00.jpg	Then the whole earth will be His Altar . " And it
d04-037-01.jpg	shall come to pass , if 1ye shall 1hearken
d04-037-02.jpg	diligently unto my commandments , which I command
d04-037-03.jpg	you this day , to love the Lord your God , and to
d04-037-04.jpg	serve Him with all your heart and with all
d04-037-05.jpg	your soul . " This may seem very good , but there
d04-037-06.jpg	is something deficient .
d04-047-00.jpg	Under such conditions without putting your
d04-047-01.jpg	mind together we cannot solve the further
d04-047-02.jpg	summons of destiny , to solve the economic
d04-047-03.jpg	problems . Hence says Rabbi Simeon ben
d04-047-04.jpg	Jochai ( Tanis 6a ) " if Israel does not fulfil
d04-047-05.jpg	the wish of the Lord , failing to serve the
d04-047-06.jpg	Lord God with all their visionary power ,
d04-047-07.jpg	the work will have to be done by each
d04-047-08.jpg	individual " .
d04-050-00.jpg	They will not work in union . If physical power , spiritual power
d04-050-01.jpg	and visionary power is not united , man will remain in his heart
d04-050-02.jpg	selfish and think only of one's personal advantage to
d04-050-03.jpg	gratify selfish aims , then each man will gather-in
d04-050-04.jpg	for himself only , instead of all to help to gather your
d04-050-05.jpg	corn , your wine and your oil .
d04-053-00.jpg	Freedom from want cannot be fulfilled nor
d04-053-01.jpg	freedom from fear , fear of starvation in the
d04-053-02.jpg	midst of plenty . Help will not be easily forth-
d04-053-03.jpg	coming for the people in need . They will
d04-053-04.jpg	think of the animals first ( which is of course
d04-053-05.jpg	our duty ) . Of course the individual will
d04-053-06.jpg	eat and be full but : " Take heed to yourself ,
d04-053-07.jpg	that your heart be not deceived , and 1ye turn
d04-053-08.jpg	aside , and serve other gods , and worship them " ,
d04-053-09.jpg	the yourself is thy greatest enemy , the self-
d04-053-10.jpg	seeking self .
d04-058-00.jpg	And you serve Mammon and God . And you cannot serve
d04-058-01.jpg	two masters , and you worship self-interest , isolating
d04-058-02.jpg	yourself , under such conditions the goods are your gods .
d04-058-03.jpg	" And then the Lord's wrath be kindled against you , and he
d04-058-04.jpg	shut up the heavens , that there is no rain , and that the land
d04-058-05.jpg	yield not her fruit and lest 1ye perish quickly from off the
d04-058-06.jpg	good land which the Lord 1giveth you . "
d04-062-00.jpg	For without the vision to serve the Lord your God with all
d04-062-01.jpg	your heart and with all your soul and with all your might
d04-062-02.jpg	the problem of life cannot be solved . " Therefore shall 1ye lay
d04-062-03.jpg	up these my words in your heart and in your soul . " The text
d04-062-04.jpg	adds and in your soul , searching your soul .
d04-066-00.jpg	And the sequence in the text is different than
d04-066-01.jpg	in the first part of the Shmah , we have first " and
d04-066-02.jpg	to bind them for a sign upon your hand , that
d04-066-03.jpg	they may be as frontlets between your eyes . " First to
d04-066-04.jpg	bind them to have the vision and then " And 1ye
d04-066-05.jpg	shall teach them to your children . " And as we have go-
d04-066-06.jpg	ne through the mill , we need not teach them
d04-066-07.jpg	to the children any more diligently and the
d04-066-08.jpg	children will grasp now what will befall
d04-066-09.jpg	them without visionary power .
d04-086-00.jpg	And the tsitsits had a message sealed inside the knots
d04-086-01.jpg	just as there is a message sealed in the four emblems which
d04-086-02.jpg	are used on Passover , to depict the " time of our freedom " .
d04-086-03.jpg	And they are ( 1 ) Matzo ; ( 2 ) Bitter Herbs ; ( 3 ) Salt-water and
d04-086-04.jpg	Charauses ( a kind of fruit mixture in likeness of the
d04-086-05.jpg	appearance of mortar ) ; and ( 4 ) an attitude to lean
d04-086-06.jpg	back .
d04-089-00.jpg	( 1 ) Matzos is deficient bread , ( LECHEM ANJO in Hebrew ) ,
d04-089-01.jpg	so are we deficient without spiritual knowledge , and to
d04-089-02.jpg	cure our mental incapacity we should be willing
d04-089-03.jpg	to learn . Education is always the most important task .
d04-089-04.jpg	Education gives : Freedom of Speech . ( 2 ) Bitter Herbs
d04-089-05.jpg	symbolises the bitterness that is hurled against us .
d04-089-06.jpg	We eat it . We accept it , to show we have self-control
d04-089-07.jpg	and that God dwells within us .
d04-096-00.jpg	Self-control gives us : Freedom to worship God . ( 3 ) Salt Water and Charauses :
d04-096-01.jpg	the salt-water at the Seder-Table represents the Covenant of the Torah
d04-096-02.jpg	( MELACH BRITH ELOHECHO in Hebrew , Salt is the covenant of 1thy God ,
d04-096-03.jpg	Levit. 2 , 13 . ) Salt preserves and we should have this salt in
d04-096-04.jpg	ourselves and have peace with one-another . And the sweet
d04-096-05.jpg	Mortar ( the CHARAUSES in Hebrew ) that binds all the " hard-
d04-096-06.jpg	facts " together and explains them , represents the Oral
d04-096-07.jpg	Tradition .
d04-101-00.jpg	We dip into both , at the Seder . And we want to understand
d04-101-01.jpg	more of the Torah and the Oral Tradition , our inheritance .
d04-101-02.jpg	Living the life of the Torah ( " dipping-in " ) makes us
d04-101-03.jpg	meek : " But the meek shall inherit the earth ; and shall
d04-101-04.jpg	delight themselves in the abundance of Peace " ( Psalm 37 ,
d04-101-05.jpg	11 ) . That gives us freedom from want .
d04-111-00.jpg	( 1 ) Matzo represents Peshat ; ( 2 ) Moraur
d04-111-01.jpg	represents Remez ; ( 3 ) Dipping-in represents
d04-111-02.jpg	Derush ; ( 4 ) Leaning-back represents Saud .
d04-111-03.jpg	( This is the PARDUS . ) Matzo represents
d04-111-04.jpg	the literal meaning of Pesach which
d04-111-05.jpg	is called : The Feast of Matzos . The
d04-111-06.jpg	Bitter-Herbs represent the spiritual
d04-111-07.jpg	principle and this gives us " a wink " ( Remez )
d04-111-08.jpg	how to live and accept all the bitterness
d04-111-09.jpg	that is hurled against us . The Salt-water
d04-111-10.jpg	and the sweet Mortar in which we dip-in represents
d04-111-11.jpg	the richness of the Law and that we should
d04-125-00.jpg	And we answer , that the Lord our God gave us " four freedoms "
d04-125-01.jpg	without which Society cannot make progress . And we drink
d04-125-02.jpg	" four cups " to thank the Lord our God for the " four
d04-125-03.jpg	freedoms " which are Divine . There are four ways of
d04-125-04.jpg	redemption : ( 1 ) I will bring you out from under the
d04-125-05.jpg	burdens of Egypt . ( 2 ) I will rid you of their bondage .
d04-131-00.jpg	( 3 ) I will redeem you . ( 4 ) I will take you to me for a
d04-131-01.jpg	people . ( 1 ) I will bring you out from under the
d04-131-02.jpg	burdens of Egypt : How was it that Israel was
d04-131-03.jpg	brought out from under the burdens of Egypt ?
d04-131-04.jpg	Because , they kept the Passover and they were
d04-131-05.jpg	eating Matzos in Egypt and the " Feast of Matzos "
d04-131-06.jpg	was known even to Abraham and Lot .
d05-008-00.jpg	The new century opened with James 1 ascending
d05-008-01.jpg	the throne . He was quite prepared to be
d05-008-02.jpg	tolerant towards Rome though the Gunpowder Plot
d05-008-03.jpg	spoiled that . The Puritans had high hopes , for
d05-008-04.jpg	James had grown up in Presbyterian Scotland ,
d05-008-05.jpg	but those hopes were dashed . True , a new Prayer
d05-008-06.jpg	Book was issued in 1604 but the Puritans
d05-008-07.jpg	derived little comfort from it .
d05-013-00.jpg	They objected to the word Absolution . So the phrase ' or
d05-013-01.jpg	the remission of sins ' was added . But Absolution remained .
d05-013-02.jpg	They objected to the word Confirmation . So the phrase
d05-013-03.jpg	' or the laying on of hands upon children baptized and
d05-013-04.jpg	able to render an account of their faith according
d05-013-05.jpg	to the Catechism following ' were added . But Confirmation
d05-013-06.jpg	remained . Other changes in the Book were equally
d05-013-07.jpg	minor except for the new section on the Sacraments
d05-013-08.jpg	added to the Catechism .
d05-021-00.jpg	This indicated how ephemeral in the Church had
d05-021-01.jpg	been the mood which produced the Black Rubric , for
d05-021-02.jpg	it says that ' the Body and Blood of Christ , which are
d05-021-03.jpg	verily and indeed taken and received by the
d05-021-04.jpg	faithful in the Lord's Supper . ' It could hardly be more
d05-021-05.jpg	definite . It was at this time , too , that King James made
d05-021-06.jpg	himself immortal by becoming associated with
d05-021-07.jpg	a Bible translation - the Authorized Version
d05-021-08.jpg	( which was never actually authorized ! ) .
d05-025-00.jpg	In that year Shakespeare had just turned
d05-025-01.jpg	forty and had written Hamlet two years
d05-025-02.jpg	before . Bacon was at work and Milton was
d05-025-03.jpg	just learning to read . James was followed by
d05-025-04.jpg	Charles , in whose reign came the Scottish
d05-025-05.jpg	Prayer Book in 1637 . Significantly this made
d05-025-06.jpg	a deliberate return to the Book of 1549 and
d05-025-07.jpg	became the foster mother of some of the most
d05-025-08.jpg	important Prayer Books in the Anglican
d05-025-09.jpg	Communion .
d05-030-00.jpg	Forever associated with Charles is Archbishop Laud ,
d05-030-01.jpg	now so much nobler a figure than former historians
d05-030-02.jpg	led us to believe . Laud was enthusiastically hated
d05-030-03.jpg	by Calvinists and Puritans , and the sentiment was
d05-030-04.jpg	mutual . But Laud was no Romanizer . One of his
d05-030-05.jpg	first public acts was a hard-hitting battle with
d05-030-06.jpg	the Jesuit , Fisher . But anyone who was friendly
d05-030-07.jpg	with James and Charles , the Puritans argued ,
d05-030-08.jpg	was necessarily a menace .
d05-040-00.jpg	Or when he found cock-fighting going on in church ?
d05-040-01.jpg	Laud made a positive approach . He set out to increase
d05-040-02.jpg	a sense of reverence . The Prayer Book was to be respected
d05-040-03.jpg	and so was the office of a bishop . Altars should be
d05-040-04.jpg	altars and not any broken down , transportable
d05-040-05.jpg	table which was handy for the most improbable uses .
d06-003-00.jpg	Even worse is to laugh . Tremendous damage may be done to a child
d06-003-01.jpg	by laughing at what are very real fears . As adults , we know
d06-003-02.jpg	that their fears are groundless , indeed to us they appear laughable ,
d06-003-03.jpg	but to a child they are very real . Not that I am suggesting
d06-003-04.jpg	that children should be molly-coddled - they must be made
d06-003-05.jpg	to face their fears , to see through them and come out on the
d06-003-06.jpg	other side as victors .
d06-008-00.jpg	To ridicule them only pushes them farther
d06-008-01.jpg	into themselves , so that they become
d06-008-02.jpg	unable to speak about it to anybody and
d06-008-03.jpg	the seeds of any amount of trouble are sown ,
d06-008-04.jpg	the harvest of which may still be being
d06-008-05.jpg	reaped at forty or fifty . Far better to
d06-008-06.jpg	agree with a child that a particular
d06-008-07.jpg	situation is frightening , and then to face
d06-008-08.jpg	it together until the child can see how
d06-008-09.jpg	unnecessary its fears were .
d06-011-00.jpg	Because situations which may contain
d06-011-01.jpg	all the elements of fear can arise suddenly ,
d06-011-02.jpg	it is a good idea to condition a child
d06-011-03.jpg	to some extent against it . To keep a child
d06-011-04.jpg	of twelve or thirteen under the
d06-011-05.jpg	impression that nothing nasty ever
d06-011-06.jpg	happens is not merely dishonest , it
d06-011-07.jpg	is unwise . As I shall suggest in a
d06-011-08.jpg	later chapter there are some situations
d06-011-09.jpg	which occur less frequently than
d06-020-00.jpg	In Gethsemane He prayed that the cup
d06-020-01.jpg	should pass from Him . Jesus shows us
d06-020-02.jpg	the way to face life . To see all the latent
d06-020-03.jpg	frightening possibilities and yet by facing
d06-020-04.jpg	them and knowing God is with us and
d06-020-05.jpg	that , with Him , there is nothing that can
d06-020-06.jpg	finally defeat us . More than that , that God
d06-020-07.jpg	has something important to do with our
d06-020-08.jpg	lives and that the nearer we get to Him ,
d06-020-09.jpg	the stronger we become .
d06-025-00.jpg	... Today A wonderful thought In the
d06-025-01.jpg	dawn was given ... And the thought
d06-025-02.jpg	Was this : That a secret plan Is hid in
d06-025-03.jpg	my hand ; That my hand is big Big ,
d06-025-04.jpg	Because of the plan That God , Who
d06-025-05.jpg	dwells in my hand , Knows this
d06-025-06.jpg	secret plan , Of the things He will
d06-025-07.jpg	do for the world Using my hand .
d06-027-00.jpg	Toyohiko Kagawa . Loving Saviour , who experienced
d06-027-01.jpg	all human emotion , and whose sensitive
d06-027-02.jpg	nature knows better than we do , what it is to
d06-027-03.jpg	be really afraid , help us to know that when
d06-027-04.jpg	we face life boldly , many of the shadows are
d06-027-05.jpg	seen to be allies and not enemies and that ,
d06-027-06.jpg	come what may , we are never alone when
d06-027-07.jpg	we are with Thee .
d06-037-00.jpg	To others , the long hours of the night bring
d06-037-01.jpg	only a disturbed tossing and turning
d06-037-02.jpg	which causes them to wake feeling worse
d06-037-03.jpg	than when they went to bed . We may begin
d06-037-04.jpg	to understand this a little better when we
d06-037-05.jpg	realize that tiredness itself is largely in
d06-037-06.jpg	the mind . Very few people , under normal
d06-037-07.jpg	conditions , work themselves to a standstill .
d06-041-00.jpg	The mind tires first and conveys the impression
d06-041-01.jpg	of tiredness to the body . This can be proved by
d06-041-02.jpg	noting the effect of a new stimulus on some-
d06-041-03.jpg	body who feels thoroughly tired . Suppose
d06-041-04.jpg	a mother has news late at night that her
d06-041-05.jpg	child is in danger . She will undertake a
d06-041-06.jpg	journey which , an hour before , she would
d06-041-07.jpg	have declared impossible .
d06-046-00.jpg	Even more simply , test your own reactions
d06-046-01.jpg	to different situations . There are some which
d06-046-02.jpg	bring on an almost immediate feeling of
d06-046-03.jpg	tiredness - such as when your wife mentions
d06-046-04.jpg	the washing-up - while others , if they
d06-046-05.jpg	refer to something you like doing , bring a
d06-046-06.jpg	veritable surge of energy . Many a girl who
d06-046-07.jpg	is ' too tired to help mum ' will later jump
d06-046-08.jpg	up with no apparent tiredness at all when
d06-046-09.jpg	her boy friend calls and go for a long walk .
d06-056-00.jpg	They drag themselves around and can become
d06-056-01.jpg	a burden to their families and their friends .
d06-056-02.jpg	Any mental confusion can cause this and
d06-056-03.jpg	the best way is probably to seek advice .
d06-056-04.jpg	As we are unable to cure our own bodies
d06-056-05.jpg	if the cause of our pain is too deep seated ,
d06-056-06.jpg	so we are unable to cure our own minds ,
d06-056-07.jpg	if the trouble is a complicated one
d06-056-08.jpg	involving careful and patient treatment .
d06-060-00.jpg	One of the greatest steps forward that has been
d06-060-01.jpg	made this century is the way in which illness
d06-060-02.jpg	of the mind is no longer feared or shunned ,
d06-060-03.jpg	and is in fact no differently regarded than
d06-060-04.jpg	physical illness . There is , nevertheless , a
d06-060-05.jpg	great deal of tiredness which comes from
d06-060-06.jpg	no major complication but results from an
d06-060-07.jpg	inability to deal with life , especially under
d06-060-08.jpg	the diverse pattern which is the twentieth
d06-060-09.jpg	century .
d06-063-00.jpg	In the days when most people were born ,
d06-063-01.jpg	lived and died within the boundaries of
d06-063-02.jpg	the village , it was not difficult for anybody
d06-063-03.jpg	to live a day at a time . Even those who
d06-063-04.jpg	held a high and responsible office lived in
d06-063-05.jpg	far greater simplicity than their successors .
d06-063-06.jpg	When news from the Continent took days ,
d06-063-07.jpg	from America weeks , from the Far East ,
d06-063-08.jpg	months , even a Prime Minister could go to
d06-063-09.jpg	sleep in blissful ignorance of what might
d06-063-10.jpg	be happening at the other end of England ,
d06-067-00.jpg	In other ways , too , life for the ordinary
d06-067-01.jpg	individual has become so complex
d06-067-02.jpg	that it taxes the mind . Two hundred
d06-067-03.jpg	years ago , men lived and worked
d06-067-04.jpg	in one place , their lives were of one
d06-067-05.jpg	piece . Now a man may live twenty ,
d06-067-06.jpg	thirty even sixty miles from his
d06-067-07.jpg	work . The only connexion is the
d06-067-08.jpg	pipeline of the railway on which they
d06-067-09.jpg	travel day by day .
d06-072-00.jpg	In many cases , their homes know little of
d06-072-01.jpg	their place of work and their associates at
d06-072-02.jpg	the office or works wonder what they
d06-072-03.jpg	are possibly like in the surroundings of their
d06-072-04.jpg	homes . It is easy , desperately easy , to lead
d06-072-05.jpg	a ' double ' life without ever deliberately
d06-072-06.jpg	planning to do so or in fact being conscious
d06-072-07.jpg	of what is going on . It is easier to live life in
d06-072-08.jpg	compartments but over the years it builds up ,
d06-072-09.jpg	and to do so inevitably builds up tensions which
d06-072-10.jpg	need to be handled correctly .
d06-076-00.jpg	Can we then frame some ' rules ' which may enable us to live life
d06-076-01.jpg	as fully as possible , without having our energy sapped by un-
d06-076-02.jpg	necessary weariness . ( a ) Order makes for a decrease in tiredness .
d06-076-03.jpg	We have a saying ' My head will never save my feet ' . Time
d06-076-04.jpg	after time we forget something and have to go back
d06-076-05.jpg	upstairs or down to the shops .
d06-086-00.jpg	The housewife would find life far less tiring
d06-086-01.jpg	if she made a list , followed a routine of work
d06-086-02.jpg	rather than getting from one thing to the next .
d06-086-03.jpg	The business man would find that he reached
d06-086-04.jpg	the end of the day with far less strain if
d06-086-05.jpg	he was a little more systematic . To drift
d06-086-06.jpg	aimlessly along is more wearying than any-
d06-086-07.jpg	thing else . If we would only sit down and
d06-086-08.jpg	write out all the necessary jobs waiting to
d06-086-09.jpg	be done and then work quietly through them ,
d06-086-10.jpg	we would find life considerably less exhausting
d06-096-00.jpg	I am more than conscious of this . How anybody
d06-096-01.jpg	can go through the same routine day in and day
d06-096-02.jpg	out for forty years I find difficult to understand .
d06-096-03.jpg	A lot of it is inevitable so that industry and
d06-096-04.jpg	commerce may be kept going - though if ever
d06-096-05.jpg	it becomes possible to work out a system
d06-096-06.jpg	of ' staggered ' hours it may do an immense
d06-096-07.jpg	amount of good over and above relieving
d06-096-08.jpg	the pressure on over-crowded trains .
d06-100-00.jpg	As it is , with so much of our life already
d06-100-01.jpg	in a predetermined groove , I would
d06-100-02.jpg	hardly like to add further to the dullness
d06-100-03.jpg	which it engenders . But I am not arguing
d06-100-04.jpg	for this . I know how much of a drag it can be
d06-100-05.jpg	and I was interested some little while
d06-100-06.jpg	ago to hear of a school who tried a six-
d06-100-07.jpg	day timetable .
d06-104-00.jpg	They only worked , of course , a five-
d06-104-01.jpg	day week so that in the first week
d06-104-02.jpg	Monday to Friday were days one
d06-104-03.jpg	to five of the timetable , the following
d06-104-04.jpg	Monday was day six and Tuesday
d06-104-05.jpg	started day one again and so on .
d06-104-06.jpg	By this means they avoided each
d06-104-07.jpg	week being the same with a pupil
d06-104-08.jpg	knowing exactly what the subject
d06-104-09.jpg	would be on Friday afternoon at
d06-104-10.jpg	3 p.m. .
d06-107-00.jpg	It was a little complicated to work ,
d06-107-01.jpg	of course , and there had to be a big
d06-107-02.jpg	notice in the entrance saying which
d06-107-03.jpg	day of the timetable it was - but
d06-107-04.jpg	it added immensely to the interest
d06-107-05.jpg	and kept everybody on their toes .
d06-107-06.jpg	To have order does not mean getting
d06-107-07.jpg	into a dull routine . I have great
d06-107-08.jpg	sympathy with the young wife
d06-107-09.jpg	who does not always want to do
d06-107-10.jpg	the washing on a Monday .
d06-111-00.jpg	I would not want to either , but if she wants to get through
d06-111-01.jpg	the day without becoming exhausted , she will be well advised to
d06-111-02.jpg	sit down quietly and make a list of everything she has got to
d06-111-03.jpg	do , note the order in which they can most conveniently be
d06-111-04.jpg	done ( or must be done because of other predetermined factors
d06-111-05.jpg	- you must , for example , do your shopping on the morning of
d06-111-06.jpg	the early closing day ) .
d06-113-00.jpg	She will , in fact , be surprised at what peace
d06-113-01.jpg	of mind ensues . ( b ) Concentrate on one
d06-113-02.jpg	thing at a time . A list or a plan enables us to
d06-113-03.jpg	put all our energies into the particular
d06-113-04.jpg	matter on hand .
d07-082-00.jpg	( Actually , the Mishnah quotes two further proof
d07-082-01.jpg	texts and the Gemara explains why these ,
d07-082-02.jpg	too , are necessary , but a careful examination
d07-082-03.jpg	of that passage makes it clear that these are
d07-082-04.jpg	not quoted here because they are not
d07-082-05.jpg	necessary to prove the point made by
d07-082-06.jpg	R. Joshua b. Levi . ) Finally , we note that
d07-082-07.jpg	the comment of Rami bar Rabh is quoted
d07-082-08.jpg	elsewhere .
d07-085-00.jpg	From the above it follows that here , once again ,
d07-085-01.jpg	we have a good illustration of how a
d07-085-02.jpg	sugya has been fashioned from material
d07-085-03.jpg	already in the hands of the Redactors .
d07-085-04.jpg	The sugya is built around the saying of
d07-085-05.jpg	R. Joshua b. Levi . The proof text for the
d07-085-06.jpg	reading of the Book of Esther is quoted
d07-085-07.jpg	with the comment given by Samuel .
d07-089-00.jpg	( This is probably to be understood as a well-
d07-089-01.jpg	known comment on the verse ; quoted by
d07-089-02.jpg	Samuel in support of his thesis and quoted
d07-089-03.jpg	by the Gemara in support of R. Joshua b.
d07-089-04.jpg	Levi's thesis ! ) The proof text of greeting by
d07-089-05.jpg	the divine Name is taken from the Mishnah .
d07-089-06.jpg	There is no reference to the Mishnah here
d07-089-07.jpg	because the Mishnah deals with the
d07-089-08.jpg	actual practice of greeting by the divine
d07-089-09.jpg	Name and the Gemara here quotes the
d07-089-10.jpg	texts to support the thesis of R. Joshua b. Levi .
d07-093-00.jpg	The question and answer with regard to the
d07-093-01.jpg	need for the text of the angel are quoted
d07-093-02.jpg	here in the same words in which they are
d07-093-03.jpg	quoted in the discussion on the Mishnah .
d07-093-04.jpg	This can either mean that both sugyas are
d07-093-05.jpg	quoting a well-known question and
d07-093-06.jpg	answer or that our sugya is quoting from
d07-093-07.jpg	the longer sugya which deals with all
d07-093-08.jpg	four texts quoted in the Mishnah .
d07-096-00.jpg	Or it is possible that our sugya contains the
d07-096-01.jpg	original question and answer and this is quoted
d07-096-02.jpg	in the other sugya . ( This can be supported by the
d07-096-03.jpg	use of the expression : ' Boaz did it of his own
d07-096-04.jpg	accord but there was no approval of his action
d07-096-05.jpg	in Heaven ' in both sugyoth . Such an
d07-096-06.jpg	expression appears to have been framed in
d07-096-07.jpg	response to the particular point at issue here ,
d07-096-08.jpg	whether the Heavenly Court concurred
d07-096-09.jpg	in the decision of the human court . )
d07-100-00.jpg	The proof text of bringing the tithe to the Temple
d07-100-01.jpg	is then quoted and the interpretation of the
d07-100-02.jpg	latter part of the verse by Rami bar Rabh
d07-100-03.jpg	is added , not because this is at all relevant
d07-100-04.jpg	to the discussion but because it was
d07-100-05.jpg	a familiar interpretation which had
d07-100-06.jpg	become so well known that it was
d07-100-07.jpg	invariably quoted whenever the verse
d07-100-08.jpg	itself was quoted , almost as if it were a
d07-100-09.jpg	part of the verse .
d07-102-00.jpg	The Gemara continues with a saying of the
d07-102-01.jpg	Palestinian teacher , R. Eleazar ( 3rd Cent. ) :
d07-102-02.jpg	' The Holy Spirit manifested itself in three places :
d07-102-03.jpg	the court of Shem , the court of Samuel of Ramah ,
d07-102-04.jpg	and the court of Solomon . ' The place of this
d07-102-05.jpg	saying here is obvious , it follows naturally
d07-102-06.jpg	on the saying of R. Joshua b. Levi which
d07-102-07.jpg	deals with a similar theme .
e01-055-00.jpg	One can remember with horror the pictures of the
e01-055-01.jpg	overcrowded and over-embellished drawing-rooms
e01-055-02.jpg	complete with heavy crochet antimacassars , mantel-
e01-055-03.jpg	piece covers with a fringing of clumsy bobbles and
e01-055-04.jpg	numerous other crocheted pieces . It was some years
e01-055-05.jpg	after the Victorian period that designers realised
e01-055-06.jpg	the potentialities of the craft , and crochet was
e01-055-07.jpg	revived with designs suitable for contemporary
e01-055-08.jpg	trends . Crochet today has a variety of uses , and
e01-055-09.jpg	has even stepped into the field of high fashion .
e06-000-00.jpg	This could hardly happen without the
e06-000-01.jpg	herring having some orientation with the
e06-000-02.jpg	sea bottom . It means that the crowding
e06-000-03.jpg	is caused during the daytime , and that
e06-000-04.jpg	the herring must continue to migrate over
e06-000-05.jpg	the ground as well as in midwater and
e06-000-06.jpg	during the swim ( the swim at East Anglia
e06-000-07.jpg	is always from the north ) .
e06-003-00.jpg	Thus we can see that herring
e06-003-01.jpg	movements , although primarily
e06-003-02.jpg	instinctive perhaps , and certainly
e06-003-03.jpg	helped and hindered by water flow ,
e06-003-04.jpg	are also closely related to the sea-bed
e06-003-05.jpg	geography . Geography , too , names the
e06-003-06.jpg	great fisheries that depend on them :
e06-003-07.jpg	the Fladen Ground ( where again most big
e06-003-08.jpg	shots are taken on the edges ) , the Gut ,
e06-003-09.jpg	a deep-water channel to the Dogger where
e06-003-10.jpg	the herring spawn along the northern
e06-010-00.jpg	In this 200-fathom trench the herring do not touch the bottom .
e06-010-01.jpg	Their descent stops at the end of the light pressure . But
e06-010-02.jpg	they migrate easterly to the Norwegian side , or westerly , until
e06-010-03.jpg	in the shallower water the mile wide layers disappear from the
e06-010-04.jpg	echo-sounders . Bottom crowding comes when they cannot reach
e06-010-05.jpg	their optimum depth ; and this coincides with the suitable
e06-010-06.jpg	gravelly soil of these many roughs where the spring-
e06-010-07.jpg	spawning herring are always found .
e06-015-00.jpg	The joint evidence of echo-sounders
e06-015-01.jpg	and fishing gear leads to an overall
e06-015-02.jpg	though somewhat dim picture .
e06-015-03.jpg	The details are harder still to see .
e06-015-04.jpg	Drift Effects . At East Anglia , for instance ,
e06-015-05.jpg	shoals that gather at the Knoll or
e06-015-06.jpg	other banks are most of them
e06-015-07.jpg	going to travel a hundred
e06-015-08.jpg	miles farther south before they
e06-015-09.jpg	spawn . Some will spawn at the
e06-021-00.jpg	So the arrival of any particular shoal
e06-021-01.jpg	fish at a certain spawning ground may
e06-021-02.jpg	be accidental . Yet there will always be some
e06-021-03.jpg	that find it if enough are travelling , just as
e06-021-04.jpg	the robin who gets back exactly may be
e06-021-05.jpg	only one among thousands who do not .
e06-021-06.jpg	But this southerly migration is not
e06-021-07.jpg	accidental . Being contranatant or against
e06-021-08.jpg	the drift , it probably has a survival value
e06-021-09.jpg	in ensuring that the fry after hatching
e06-021-10.jpg	are drifted back into the normal home
e06-026-00.jpg	Drift in another form probably
e06-026-01.jpg	explains how these migrating herring
e06-026-02.jpg	are biased to east or west by the
e06-026-03.jpg	different winds . Strong westerlies
e06-026-04.jpg	are well known to bring good
e06-026-05.jpg	longshore fishings . The surface
e06-026-06.jpg	water that is blown offshore must
e06-026-07.jpg	be replaced by an underflow bringing
e06-026-08.jpg	with it the herring to the Norfolk
e06-026-09.jpg	and Suffolk beaches .
e06-030-00.jpg	Easterly winds , on the other hand ,
e06-030-01.jpg	mean no herring along the shore , as
e06-030-02.jpg	recent years have shown . A succession
e06-030-03.jpg	of winds is needed for this effect of
e06-030-04.jpg	course - one breeze will not do it ,
e06-030-05.jpg	though a very hard westerly will
e06-030-06.jpg	often start off the " local " herring ;
e06-030-07.jpg	but quite apart from this wind effect
e06-030-08.jpg	there is an easterly drift special
e06-030-09.jpg	to this rump of coastline , caused by
e06-030-10.jpg	the meeting of water from north and south .
e06-033-00.jpg	Herring fishermen call this " the outset " . It
e06-033-01.jpg	is strongest at spring tides , when without
e06-033-02.jpg	wind you will " set " out - or drift to the east-
e06-033-03.jpg	ward , the length of half a fleet of nets -
e06-033-04.jpg	almost a mile on every tide at the Smith's
e06-033-05.jpg	Knoll . Without an explanation of how it
e06-033-06.jpg	works , it may well be that this outset , akin
e06-033-07.jpg	to the mouth of a great salmon river , has
e06-033-08.jpg	been the biggest factor through the ages
e06-033-09.jpg	in the constancy of this great herring fishery .
e06-046-00.jpg	( Just how the seine ropes do this is not yet proved ; it may
e06-046-01.jpg	be by actual contact , or by sight reaction to the disturbed
e06-046-02.jpg	sand ; or even in the case of flat fish , by vibrations
e06-046-03.jpg	through or along the bottom . ) But given such a bow
e06-046-04.jpg	wave of disturbance , it is obvious that without something
e06-046-05.jpg	to overcome its effect , very few fish would be caught .
e06-049-00.jpg	Let us consider first what would
e06-049-01.jpg	appear to be the simplest case -
e06-049-02.jpg	that of flat fish on the bottom .
e06-049-03.jpg	The evidence suggest that the fish are
e06-049-04.jpg	aware of the moving footrope before
e06-049-05.jpg	it reaches them . They move away before
e06-049-06.jpg	it , swimming at the same speed
e06-049-07.jpg	for an unknown period of time , until
e06-049-08.jpg	they become ( 1 ) tired , or ( 2 ) more used
e06-049-09.jpg	to the disturbance .
e06-053-00.jpg	Then they stop swimming and are caught . In
e06-053-01.jpg	the seine-net film this usually seemed to
e06-053-02.jpg	happen just after the fish had risen above
e06-053-03.jpg	the footrope , and presumably out of its
e06-053-04.jpg	field of disturbance , or bow wave . This suggests
e06-053-05.jpg	that the wave might be transmitted by the
e06-053-06.jpg	sea-bed , though the footrope in this case
e06-053-07.jpg	was actually just off the bottom and was
e06-053-08.jpg	indeed passing over some fish .
e06-070-00.jpg	Actually the seine net has little or no cover .
e06-070-01.jpg	And in this film the rise of the fish was
e06-070-02.jpg	small , a matter of a foot or two . With round
e06-070-03.jpg	fish like haddock , which would hardly
e06-070-04.jpg	find safety on the bottom , this cover
e06-070-05.jpg	would seem to be even more essential ;
e06-070-06.jpg	but more films are needed to prove this .
e06-070-07.jpg	Cover in the fast-moving trawl is considered
e06-070-08.jpg	essential to catch round fish whose
e06-070-09.jpg	reaction to disturbance would be upwards .
f04-032-00.jpg	They also had to cope with the usual flood of rumours , so-
f04-032-01.jpg	me well meant , some mischievous , including one that a
f04-032-02.jpg	man had been seen fleeing from Vauxhall station on
f04-032-03.jpg	the Thursday evening , with blood actually dripping from
f04-032-04.jpg	his hands . The inquest was opened on February 17 , but ,
f04-032-05.jpg	beyond the jury hearing a formal identification of
f04-032-06.jpg	the victim and inspecting at Waterloo the carriage
f04-032-07.jpg	in which she had died , there was nothing on
f04-032-08.jpg	which to proceed , and the inquest was
f04-032-09.jpg	adjourned .
f04-035-00.jpg	Day by day the police followed up likely and even unlikely
f04-035-01.jpg	trails . It was learned that Elizabeth Camp had been lending
f04-035-02.jpg	money to her relatives , and her brother-in-law was asked for
f04-035-03.jpg	a detailed account of his movements on the 11th . The dead
f04-035-04.jpg	woman had been engaged once before - to a barman
f04-035-05.jpg	named Brown .
f04-039-00.jpg	This man agreed that his engagement had
f04-039-01.jpg	been broken off after one particular
f04-039-02.jpg	tiff , but denied that he owed Miss Camp any
f04-039-03.jpg	money . All the while the police were casting about
f04-039-04.jpg	for a man who had been seen leaving the train
f04-039-05.jpg	at Wandsworth . A passenger described this individual
f04-039-06.jpg	as a man of about thirty , of medium height , with
f04-039-07.jpg	a dark moustache , and wearing a frockcoat
f04-039-08.jpg	and a top-hat .
f04-043-00.jpg	The porter at the station bore out this
f04-043-01.jpg	description , but the man was not traced .
f04-043-02.jpg	Perhaps the news of their search got around ,
f04-043-03.jpg	for a man did obligingly present himself
f04-043-04.jpg	at Wandsworth police-station , claiming to have
f04-043-05.jpg	committed the murder - but he was mentally
f04-043-06.jpg	defective , and , despite his claim to infamy ,
f04-043-07.jpg	had been nowhere near the 7.42 that evening .
f04-053-00.jpg	And so the inquest , which had dragged on , with
f04-053-01.jpg	adjournments , until April 7 , finally had to be content to return
f04-053-02.jpg	a verdict of " wilful murder against some person or
f04-053-03.jpg	persons unknown . " The most vital clue of the Wedgwood
f04-053-04.jpg	pestle had been of no assistance . The killer must
f04-053-05.jpg	have been very thankful that the science of
f04-053-06.jpg	dactyloscopy was only in its beginnings .
f04-057-00.jpg	The next female fatality occurred eight years later ,
f04-057-01.jpg	yet so strange were the circumstances that it was
f04-057-02.jpg	a further seven years before even a ghost of a
f04-057-03.jpg	solution emerged . There has always been something
f04-057-04.jpg	sinister in the idea of tunnels . The building of
f04-057-05.jpg	them was one of the most dangerous jobs con-
f04-057-06.jpg	nected with railway construction ; and there
f04-057-07.jpg	were many people who believed that to travel
f04-057-08.jpg	through tunnels would be an equally
f04-057-09.jpg	hazardous business .
f04-061-00.jpg	Some thought that the result would be all
f04-061-01.jpg	sorts of horrible illnesses brought on by the
f04-061-02.jpg	confined atmosphere . " The shareholders who travel
f04-061-03.jpg	by it will be so heartily sick , what with the
f04-061-04.jpg	foul air , smoke and sulphur , that the mention
f04-061-05.jpg	of a railway will be worse than Ipecacuanha , "
f04-061-06.jpg	wrote an anti-railway industrialist when it was
f04-061-07.jpg	proposed to build the Box Tunnel .
f04-064-00.jpg	The mere thought of subterranean travel
f04-064-01.jpg	gave others a feeling of danger . A medical journal
f04-064-02.jpg	said , " the deafening peal of thunder , the sudden
f04-064-03.jpg	immersion in gloom , and the clash of reverberated
f04-064-04.jpg	sounds in a confined space combine to produce a
f04-064-05.jpg	momentary shudder , or idea of destruction , a thrill
f04-064-06.jpg	of annihilation . " It was also prophesied that
f04-064-07.jpg	passengers would be robbed and assaulted in the
f04-064-08.jpg	darkness .
f04-068-00.jpg	For all that , as far as England is concerned ,
f04-068-01.jpg	there have been only two occasions on
f04-068-02.jpg	which a body has been found in a tunnel
f04-068-03.jpg	in circumstances pointing to murder .
f04-068-04.jpg	The first was that of Mr Gold , in the famous
f04-068-05.jpg	Lefroy case , and by an odd chance the second tragedy
f04-068-06.jpg	occurred on the same line , although this time the
f04-068-07.jpg	victim was a woman .
f04-071-00.jpg	Though in the minds of most people there was
f04-071-01.jpg	no doubt that the woman had been the victim
f04-071-02.jpg	of foul play , the verdict brought in was that there
f04-071-03.jpg	was not sufficient evidence to show whether
f04-071-04.jpg	she had fallen or been thrown from a train .
f04-071-05.jpg	The Merstham Tunnel , on the London-to-
f04-071-06.jpg	Brighton line , is approximately one mile long ,
f04-071-07.jpg	and some time before midnight on September
f04-071-08.jpg	24 , 1905 , a Sunday , Sub-Inspector Peacock , of
f04-071-09.jpg	the London , Brighton and South Coast Railway ,
f04-074-00.jpg	It was the battered and broken body of a woman .
f04-074-01.jpg	He sent word straight away to near-by Merstham
f04-074-02.jpg	Station , and a stretcher party took the body to
f04-074-03.jpg	the Feathers Hotel to await identification .
f04-074-04.jpg	Was it a case of suicide , where some unhappy soul
f04-074-05.jpg	had walked deliberately into the blackness and
f04-074-06.jpg	into the path of some train ? This hardly seemed
f04-074-07.jpg	likely , since , when she was examined by a local
f04-074-08.jpg	doctor , the woman , young , small , and rather plump ,
f04-074-09.jpg	was found to have her own silk scarf drawn
f04-074-10.jpg	almost tight enough to strangle her , and the ends
f04-074-11.jpg	thrust in her mouth like a gag .
f04-079-00.jpg	Both her wrists bore the marks of severe bruising ,
f04-079-01.jpg	and there were other injuries on her body which had
f04-079-02.jpg	occurred before her death was ensured by some
f04-079-03.jpg	train which had roared through the tunnel . There were
f04-079-04.jpg	no letters or papers found on her to assist identi
f04-079-05.jpg	fication , no money , and no railway ticket . By then
f04-079-06.jpg	reports were being gathered about all traffic over
f04-079-07.jpg	this stretch of line , but no information was
f04-079-08.jpg	forthcoming about any carriage with an open
f04-079-09.jpg	door , nor any passenger reporting an incident
f04-079-10.jpg	which might relate .
f04-083-00.jpg	So the body of this small girl with the blue eyes and
f04-083-01.jpg	long brown hair in a bun at the back of her head
f04-083-02.jpg	remained a mystery until later the following day .
f04-083-03.jpg	During that time a description of the girl was
f04-083-04.jpg	circulated , and a Mr Robert Money came forward to
f04-083-05.jpg	identify her as his sister , Mary Money , aged twenty-two .
f04-083-06.jpg	The girl , who was described as being " always bright and
f04-083-07.jpg	jolly , " had been unmarried , and lived at Lavender Hill ,
f04-083-08.jpg	Clapham , on the premises of a dairyman , Bridger , for
f04-083-09.jpg	whom she worked as a book-keeper .
f04-087-00.jpg	On the Sunday , the day of her death , she had gone out in the
f04-087-01.jpg	evening at about seven o'clock , telling her room-mate , Emma
f04-087-02.jpg	Hone , that she was going for a walk , but would not be
f04-087-03.jpg	gone for long . According to Miss Hone , she had not been
f04-087-04.jpg	carrying a handbag , but she believed she had had a small
f04-087-05.jpg	purse .
f07-000-00.jpg	SOME years ago a contemporary philosopher
f07-000-01.jpg	told us that there was nothing an En-
f07-000-02.jpg	glishman would not do ; nothing an Ame-
f07-000-03.jpg	rican would not say ; nothing an
f07-000-04.jpg	Italian would not sing ; no music
f07-000-05.jpg	to which the Frenchman would not
f07-000-06.jpg	dance ; nothing the German would
f07-000-07.jpg	not covet ; and nothing the Chinese
f07-000-08.jpg	would not eat .
f07-000b-00.jpg	SOME years ago a contemporary philosopher
f07-000b-01.jpg	told us that there was nothing an Englishman
f07-000b-02.jpg	would not do ; nothing an American would not
f07-000b-03.jpg	say ; nothing an Italian would not sing ; no
f07-000b-04.jpg	music to which the Frenchman would not dance ;
f07-000b-05.jpg	nothing the German would not covet ; and
f07-000b-06.jpg	nothing the Chinese would not eat .
f07-002-00.jpg	It is not our purpose to discuss this dictum .
f07-002-01.jpg	Suffice to say that few of us stop to marvel at
f07-002-02.jpg	the progress of civilisation which allows a dish
f07-002-03.jpg	borrowed straight from the prehistoric . How
f07-002-04.jpg	many centuries ago , in some cave or hilly
f07-002-05.jpg	hide , did our forebears home from the chase
f07-002-06.jpg	hold forth from a spear the welcome gobbet of
f07-002-07.jpg	meat or fish burnt and roasted in the
f07-002-08.jpg	homely and protecting flame .
f07-006-00.jpg	How many centuries later did the mercenary in
f07-006-01.jpg	the Roman wars thus impale on pike or lance his
f07-006-02.jpg	evening meal . Later came the thrifty peasant ,
f07-006-03.jpg	later still the young Victorian buck adventuring
f07-006-04.jpg	in Paris , and even later our attractive young
f07-006-05.jpg	ladies toying with these primitive morsels in the
f07-006-06.jpg	gleam and glitter of our latter-day restaurants .
f07-009-00.jpg	And , if certain dishes and modes of food have
f07-009-01.jpg	persisted down the ages , the motive that preserved
f07-009-02.jpg	them has always been the same . Apart from the need
f07-009-03.jpg	for nourishment , the instinct of hospitality has
f07-009-04.jpg	always been strong in mankind . The sharing of
f07-009-05.jpg	a meal in those earliest dangerous days was an
f07-009-06.jpg	admittance into an acquaintanceship far more
f07-009-07.jpg	important than the casual meetings of the present
f07-009-08.jpg	day ; the desire to share something more intimate
f07-009-09.jpg	than mere converse has always been there .
f07-013-00.jpg	The truth is that good food offers a
f07-013-01.jpg	programme of entertainment almost
f07-013-02.jpg	unlimited in its variety and its presen-
f07-013-03.jpg	tation affords an opportunity of
f07-013-04.jpg	showing a guest something of ourselves .
f07-013-05.jpg	It is a far enough cry from the primitive
f07-013-06.jpg	meal-times of a simpler world to the
f07-013-07.jpg	banquets of later days , when the table
f07-013-08.jpg	groaned under its load of complicated
f07-013-09.jpg	dishes , and for all the blossoming of the
f07-013-10.jpg	arts around them the diners were little
f07-016-00.jpg	There was always the spice of an orgy
f07-016-01.jpg	in those Roman feasts , for instance , with
f07-016-02.jpg	all their peacocks and nightingales'
f07-016-03.jpg	tongues ; unreasonable surfeit , too , in the
f07-016-04.jpg	elaborate fashion of eating brought
f07-016-05.jpg	out of Italy into France , we are told ,
f07-016-06.jpg	by Catherine de Medici . The peasant in
f07-016-07.jpg	those days , as ever , ate sparingly , but
f07-016-08.jpg	generously enough in his own fashion ,
f07-016-09.jpg	save at feast times , when he , too , let
f07-016-10.jpg	himself go ; and it was from his simpler
f07-019a-00.jpg	Epicures and gourmands , sated by the unending
f07-019a-01.jpg	procession of dishes from those mammoth kitchens
f07-019a-02.jpg	of the 18th century - that amazing epoch of
f07-019a-03.jpg	grossness and delicacy - sought inspiration at last from
f07-019a-04.jpg	the dishes of the country , and , instead of gorging the
f07-019a-05.jpg	eye with magnitude , began to understand the value of
f07-019a-06.jpg	intelligent selection and comparative simplicity , though
f07-019a-07.jpg	nowadays their simplified meals would seem quite
f07-019a-08.jpg	monstrous .

f07-021a-00.jpg	Does one , however , know who first thought of boiling
f07-021a-01.jpg	water and food ? The ancient Britons , I believe , used to
f07-021a-02.jpg	make water hot by dropping a red-hot poker into it ,
f07-021a-03.jpg	because their pots would not stand fire ; but Jacob
f07-021a-04.jpg	must have had one that would , because Esau sold
f07-021a-05.jpg	his birthright to him for a mess of pottage - and
f07-021a-06.jpg	then we hear of the fleshpots of Egypt after
f07-021a-07.jpg	which the Israelites sighed .

f07-024a-00.jpg	Anyhow , Homer does not seem to have known any
f07-024a-01.jpg	way of cooking meat except by roasting and boiling .
f07-024a-02.jpg	When Achilles gave a royal feast the principal dish
f07-024a-03.jpg	was a grill , which he cooked himself , and he knew
f07-024a-04.jpg	how to do it , too : - When the languid flames at
f07-024a-05.jpg	length subside , He throws a bed of glowing
f07-024a-06.jpg	embers wide ; Above the coals the smoking
f07-024a-07.jpg	fragment turns , And sprinkles sacred salt from
f07-024a-08.jpg	lifted urns
f07-024b-00.jpg	Anyhow , Homer does not seem to have
f07-024b-01.jpg	known any way of cooking meat
f07-024b-02.jpg	except by roasting and boiling . When
f07-024b-03.jpg	Achilles gave a royal feast the principal
f07-024b-04.jpg	dish was a grill , which he cooked himself ,

f07-024b-08.jpg	Above the coals the smoking fragment
f07-024b-09.jpg	turns , And sprinkles sacred salt
f07-024b-10.jpg	from lifted urns .
f07-028a-00.jpg	When , however , the Greeks did learn the art of making
f07-028a-01.jpg	fireproof earthenware from the Egyptians , their cookery
f07-028a-02.jpg	made rapid progress , because they were men of taste
f07-028a-03.jpg	and intellect . A remarkable peculiarity in the banquets
f07-028a-04.jpg	of the ancient world was the fact that they did not
f07-028a-05.jpg	confine the resources of the table to the gratification
f07-028a-06.jpg	of one sense alone . Having exhausted their invention
f07-028a-07.jpg	in the preparation of stimulants for the palate ,
f07-028a-08.jpg	they broke fresh ground and called another sense
f07-028a-09.jpg	to their aid .
f07-032a-00.jpg	By delicate application of odours and richly-distilled
f07-032a-01.jpg	perfumes , these refined voluptuaries aroused the
f07-032a-02.jpg	fainting appetite and added a more exquisite and
f07-032a-03.jpg	ethereal enjoyment to the grosser pleasures of the
f07-032a-04.jpg	board . The gratification of the sense of smelling
f07-032a-05.jpg	was a subject of no little importance to the Romans .
f07-032a-06.jpg	They considered flowers as forming a very essential
f07-032a-07.jpg	article in their festal preparations ; and it is the
f07-032a-08.jpg	opinion of Bassius that at their desserts the
f07-032a-09.jpg	number of flowers far exceeded the number
f07-032a-10.jpg	of fruits .
f07-039a-00.jpg	According to Pliny , and others , certain herbs
f07-039a-01.jpg	and flowers proved of sovereign power
f07-039a-02.jpg	clarifying the functions of the brain . It
f07-039a-03.jpg	is said that there is nothing new under
f07-039a-04.jpg	the sun , but regarding foodstuffs the
f07-039a-05.jpg	traveller occasionally encounters a certain
f07-039a-06.jpg	measure of novelty .
f07-042a-00.jpg	In China , for instance , dried rats are esteemed
f07-042a-01.jpg	a delicacy . The visitor is told that
f07-042a-02.jpg	they restore the hair of the bald and that
f07-042a-03.jpg	a stewed black rat will ward off a fever .
f07-042a-04.jpg	A number of newly-born white mice served
f07-042a-05.jpg	alive , dipped in treacle and swallowed
f07-042a-06.jpg	like a prairie oyster is considered a
f07-042a-07.jpg	piece of resistance .
f07-046a-00.jpg	Among the natives of Northern Australia lizards
f07-046a-01.jpg	roasted on the point of a spear are
f07-046a-02.jpg	definitely a delicacy while Mediterranean
f07-046a-03.jpg	peoples have a high opinion of the octopus
f07-046a-04.jpg	as an article of diet . So have the Japanese
f07-046a-05.jpg	and the Chinese . The Celestials , apart
f07-046a-06.jpg	from eating it fresh , squash it , press
f07-046a-07.jpg	it and dry it , in which form , dusted
f07-046a-08.jpg	over with flour , you will find a stack
f07-046a-09.jpg	of it in almost any provision shop .
f07-069-00.jpg	Foodlore reflects much more of national temperament
f07-069-01.jpg	than is customarily imagined as well as entering human
f07-069-02.jpg	activities to a greater extent than is usually assumed .
f07-069-03.jpg	We naturally cannot overlook that Magyar cookery owes
f07-069-04.jpg	one of its most classic features to the Turkish rule under
f07-069-05.jpg	which the Hungarians groaned for nearly 200 years .
f07-069-06.jpg	If that country had not been for so long a battlefield red
f07-069-07.jpg	with the blood shed to defend Christian civilisation ,
f07-069-08.jpg	Hungary would have been deprived of the condiment which
f07-069-09.jpg	provides many Magyar dishes with a vivid and brilliant
f07-073-00.jpg	The Austrian cuisine embraces the delectable 6Wiener
f07-073-01.jpg	Schnitzel as well as dishes and stews heightened with
f07-073-02.jpg	aromatics where the paprika insinuates its perfidious
f07-073-03.jpg	fire , aerian creams , ingenious pastries and a
f07-073-04.jpg	crescent-shaped breakfast roll created by a pastry cook to
f07-073-05.jpg	celebrate the victory against the Turks in 1683 . Spanish
f07-073-06.jpg	cookery is reminiscent of bull-fights , of Spanish dancing
f07-073-07.jpg	and of Goja : it is vivid , highly coloured , sometimes
f07-073-08.jpg	Quixotic and withal it has a sombre ardour , with
f07-073-09.jpg	streaks of poetry , meat disguised under heavy and vehement
f07-076a-00.jpg	The Czechoslovak kitchen , again , is
f07-076a-01.jpg	so languorous , so passionate , and
f07-076a-02.jpg	possibly comparable alone to a gypsy
f07-076a-03.jpg	melody . The paprika and caraway perfume
f07-076a-04.jpg	the meats with their antithesis . The
f07-076a-05.jpg	opulent varieties of Czechoslovak past-
f07-076a-06.jpg	ries recall in fact the rich heritage
f07-076a-07.jpg	of rich embroideries and costumes
f07-076a-08.jpg	specifically national . The art and
f07-076a-09.jpg	science of cookery , however , is
f07-076a-10.jpg	essentially French , and , irrespective of
f07-081a-00.jpg	The French have an inborn appreciation
f07-081a-01.jpg	of good food and the gusto which they
f07-081a-02.jpg	derive from gastronomy is intellectual
f07-081a-03.jpg	and aesthetic as well as physical .
f07-081a-04.jpg	There is the same finesse about their
f07-081a-05.jpg	feeding , the same subtle delicacy of
f07-081a-06.jpg	touch , the same unfailing sense of
f07-081a-07.jpg	proportion as exists among her
f07-081a-08.jpg	writers , music composers and other
f07-081a-09.jpg	exponents of things that are

f07-088a-00.jpg	A fascinating study also opens up in
f07-088a-01.jpg	the dietary welcomed by men of genius
f07-088a-02.jpg	as well as the foods for which they have
f07-088a-03.jpg	had an aversion . Shelley , for example ,
f07-088a-04.jpg	had a great contempt for animal
f07-088a-05.jpg	food , believing that it impaired the
f07-088a-06.jpg	intellectual faculties . Bunyan's break-
f07-088a-07.jpg	fast and supper consisted of a
f07-088a-08.jpg	piece of coarse bread and a
f07-088a-09.jpg	bowl of milk .

f07-092a-00.jpg	Dante Gabriel Rossetti had simple tastes
f07-092a-01.jpg	in food . At one dinner he is said to have
f07-092a-02.jpg	been blind to the charms of turbot and
f07-092a-03.jpg	to have been much more interested
f07-092a-04.jpg	in the dish in which it was served . He
f07-092a-05.jpg	turned it over on the table cloth to
f07-092a-06.jpg	examine the marks on the back
f07-092a-07.jpg	without going through the formality
f07-092a-08.jpg	of having his turbot removed first .

f07-096-00.jpg	Wagner was a highly practical feeder . He ate very fast ,
f07-096-01.jpg	placing his food in his mouth and gulping it down as
f07-096-02.jpg	he talked . Brigham Young would make a dinner on tripe
f07-096-03.jpg	which he washed down with beer . A writer who had dinner
f07-096-04.jpg	with Dickens says the menu was Whitstable oysters , a brown
f07-096-05.jpg	sole , a baked leg of mutton with oyster & veal stuffing and a
f07-096-06.jpg	gin punch .
f07-101b-00.jpg	The same man went to see Carlyle , and , after mentioning
f07-101b-01.jpg	that he had dined with Longfellow told the sage a
f07-101b-02.jpg	very funny story which made Carlyle absolutely laugh ;
f07-101b-03.jpg	but all the Chelsea philosopher did in return was to
f07-101b-04.jpg	ask if his guest would have a cup of tea !
g01-004-00.jpg	It was naturally a highly popular victory with the
g01-004-01.jpg	Londoners , but it brought heavy censure from nobles
g01-004-02.jpg	who still believed that they had a monopoly of
g01-004-03.jpg	leadership . But , at last , Gaunt sailed . Opposing
g01-004-04.jpg	him was the French Admiral , Jean de Vienne -
g01-004-05.jpg	a great sailor and an able strategist .
g01-008-00.jpg	Obedient to the policy of his King , de Vienne avoided
g01-008-01.jpg	trouble at sea as cleverly as Du Guesclin avoided it
g01-008-02.jpg	on land . Gaunt was compelled to give up his search for
g01-008-03.jpg	an elusive foe , and , afraid to return home without
g01-008-04.jpg	something to show , he foolishly attempted to besiege
g01-008-05.jpg	the well-protected fortress of St Malo . This
g01-008-06.jpg	involved the dreary method of mining operations in
g01-008-07.jpg	which Gaunt , under the Black Prince , had shown
g01-008-08.jpg	considerable skill at the siege of Limoges .
g01-012-00.jpg	When all seemed to be going well , a sortie surprised
g01-012-01.jpg	moment had charge of the mine ; the mine collapsed
g01-012-02.jpg	fame and glory . Gaunt was compelled to return
g01-012-03.jpg	even despised failure . The ' ribald ' Londoners , who
g01-012-04.jpg	Hawley , were also expressing their disappointment
g01-012-05.jpg	comparing the failure of a subsidized duke
g01-012-06.jpg	citizen .
g01-016-00.jpg	These dreary years of ineffective fighting provide
g01-016-01.jpg	obvious morals for those who are judges long
g01-016-02.jpg	after the event . It seems obvious that , though
g01-016-03.jpg	the longbows of yeomen could pierce the
g01-016-04.jpg	plate and mail of French knights , a brilliant
g01-016-05.jpg	battle was no substitute for a sound policy ,
g01-016-06.jpg	and that , if archers had no target , campaigns
g01-016-07.jpg	became mere marauding route marches .
g01-019-00.jpg	It seems obvious that if an expedition to
g01-019-01.jpg	Brittany was compelled to attack via Calais ,
g01-019-02.jpg	then the primary essential to the success
g01-019-03.jpg	of the French war was a navy in unquestioned
g01-019-04.jpg	command of the Channel . It seems obvious
g01-019-05.jpg	that divided forces were dissipating the
g01-019-06.jpg	advantages of a ring of bridge-heads which included
g01-019-07.jpg	Calais , Cherbourg , Brest , Bordeaux and Bayonne ,
g01-019-08.jpg	and that there was no hope of final victory
g01-019-09.jpg	without a large-scale and concentrated invasion .
g01-025-00.jpg	In this cruel process which was
g01-025-01.jpg	hammering out nations on the anvils of
g01-025-02.jpg	war , there was a constant stirring of
g01-025-03.jpg	those in authority to find some simple
g01-025-04.jpg	way out of the complicated financial
g01-025-05.jpg	6impasse which always resulted , and in the
g01-025-06.jpg	story of the experiments and expedients
g01-025-07.jpg	to which the Exchequer resorted is
g01-025-08.jpg	the story of the prelude to the
g01-025-09.jpg	Peasants' Revolt of 1381 .
g01-027-00.jpg	In appreciating this story , modern con-
g01-027-01.jpg	ceptions of governmental duties must be
g01-027-02.jpg	set aside . A modern government needs
g01-027-03.jpg	taxation not merely for defence and
g01-027-04.jpg	offence but for a very wide range of
g01-027-05.jpg	social services . A mediaeval oligarchy
g01-027-06.jpg	needed taxation in order to supplement
g01-027-07.jpg	the private wealth of the monarchy
g01-027-08.jpg	( the royal income from the revenues of
g01-027-09.jpg	crown lands , the fees of feudalism
g01-031-00.jpg	Social service as a function of government
g01-031-01.jpg	was quite alien to mediaeval thought - its
g01-031-02.jpg	substitute was the mutual self-help of
g01-031-03.jpg	communities , whether those communities were
g01-031-04.jpg	monasteries , manors , townships , or wards and
g01-031-05.jpg	guilds of a city . A mediaeval tax was
g01-031-06.jpg	therefore in essence a forced payment whose
g01-031-07.jpg	return was the uncertain bounty of booty
g01-031-08.jpg	and the vague advantages of military glory ;
g01-031-09.jpg	it was therefore always granted grudgingly
g01-031-10.jpg	and coupled with the vain hope that , in the
g01-034-00.jpg	When ' his ' war did not bring victory and
g01-034-01.jpg	booty , a new group of Lords might oust
g01-034-02.jpg	the unsuccessful leaders , and the Commons ,
g01-034-03.jpg	who usually supplied the hard cash , might
g01-034-04.jpg	be bold enough to demand the production of
g01-034-05.jpg	accounts , and even at times the impeachment of
g01-034-06.jpg	the unsuccessful . But the Commons were not
g01-034-07.jpg	the people , and even a full Parliament was
g01-034-08.jpg	not yet a true mirror of the nation .
g01-037-00.jpg	The people - Langland's ' folk ' and Gaunt's
g01-037-01.jpg	' knaves ' - were villeins still tied to the
g01-037-02.jpg	feudal obligations of work or villeins who
g01-037-03.jpg	had bought their release , free labourers
g01-037-04.jpg	who worked for the highest bidders , free
g01-037-05.jpg	yeomen who had prospered enough to become
g01-037-06.jpg	successful farmers , the artisans , craftsmen ,
g01-037-07.jpg	journeymen and small tradesmen of the
g01-037-08.jpg	towns , and the retainers and men-at-arms
g01-037-09.jpg	in the pay of landed Lords .
g01-039-00.jpg	None of these classes , except the yeomen , paid or
g01-039-01.jpg	expected to pay direct taxes . During the four-
g01-039-02.jpg	teenth century , the traditional methods of
g01-039-03.jpg	financing the Exchequer had become stabilized .
g01-039-04.jpg	When the King and his Council required additio-
g01-039-05.jpg	nal funds , they were usually granted an
g01-039-06.jpg	export tax on the wool trade , collected by
g01-039-07.jpg	means of that ' staple ' system which ensured that
g01-039-08.jpg	prices , quality and tax could be efficiently su-
g01-039-09.jpg	pervised and controlled , together with a
g01-043-00.jpg	There were two other sources of public revenue -
g01-043-01.jpg	first , the Church , which wisely followed the lead
g01-043-02.jpg	of the Commons and in its own Convocations
g01-043-03.jpg	granted equivalent contributions , and second ,
g01-043-04.jpg	the foreign merchants , with whom the King's
g01-043-05.jpg	officials had formerly made private bargains
g01-043-06.jpg	at ' colloquies of merchants ' , and whose
g01-043-07.jpg	payments were now authorized by parliamentary
g01-043-08.jpg	sanction at a rate roughly fifty per cent in
g01-043-09.jpg	excess of the rate for native merchants .
g01-045-00.jpg	In addition to these revenues , the King had the
g01-045-01.jpg	financial benefits of his position at the head
g01-045-02.jpg	of the feudal system , as its chief landowner
g01-045-03.jpg	and the recipient of the fines of royal justice .
g01-045-04.jpg	It was , therefore , a complicated and not very
g01-045-05.jpg	satisfactory financial system in which the
g01-045-06.jpg	borders between private and public purse were
g01-045-07.jpg	as ill-defined as the borders between private
g01-045-08.jpg	and national war , and in which the comparati-
g01-045-09.jpg	vely simple obligations of the feudal pyramid
g01-067-00.jpg	But this time there was a very interesting
g01-067-01.jpg	attempt to apply a sliding scale to the
g01-067-02.jpg	payments demanded . The definition of an
g01-067-03.jpg	adult was altered to read ' over sixteen ' ,
g01-067-04.jpg	and , where the poorest were to pay a groat ,
g01-067-05.jpg	the Duke of Lancaster and the Archbishops
g01-067-06.jpg	of Canterbury and York were to pay ten marks ,
g01-067-07.jpg	and between these two extremes a graduated
g01-067-08.jpg	scale of payments was fixed for the
g01-067-09.jpg	different classes of laymen and clerics .
g01-070-00.jpg	Again the resentment was widespread and
g01-070-01.jpg	the results disappointing - a tax estimated
g01-070-02.jpg	to yield 50,000 in fact raised only 27,000 .
g01-070-03.jpg	In the following year , 1380 , the last and
g01-070-04.jpg	most notorious third poll-tax was agreed
g01-070-05.jpg	by a Parliament which met at Northampton .
g01-070-06.jpg	There were dark reasons for a meeting so
g01-070-07.jpg	far away from the capital in a town with
g01-070-08.jpg	poor communications and not over supplied
g01-070-09.jpg	with hostelries and lodgings .
g01-074-00.jpg	London was again in turmoil ; but this time
g01-074-01.jpg	over a question of trade rivalry . A rich mer-
g01-074-02.jpg	chant from Genoa had been murdered , and
g01-074-03.jpg	John de Kyrkby , a Londoner , was one of
g01-074-04.jpg	those charged with the crime . It is clear
g01-074-05.jpg	from the chronicles that this was a sordid
g01-074-06.jpg	quarrel between monopolists and interlopers .
g01-074-07.jpg	The city merchants were jealous of foreign
g01-074-08.jpg	merchants who could tempt court and
g01-074-09.jpg	baronage with rarer luxuries than those
g01-088-00.jpg	Trebling the rate was arrived at by a simple
g01-088-01.jpg	arithmetic which argued that , as the first
g01-088-02.jpg	poll-tax had supplied 22,000 , a tax of
g01-088-03.jpg	three times the rate would produce 66,000 .
g01-088-04.jpg	The only concession made in view of the
g01-088-05.jpg	objections to the first two poll-taxes was
g01-088-06.jpg	the suggestion that the rich should help
g01-088-07.jpg	the poor - but this was only a pious hope
g01-088-08.jpg	because no machinery was provided for
g01-088-09.jpg	carrying it into effect , and a subordinate
g02-059-00.jpg	In Chapter Two he gauged the nature of the heart's movements
g02-059-01.jpg	from the dissection of living animals , showing how these move-
g02-059-02.jpg	ments alternate with rests and are seen best in cold animals
g02-059-03.jpg	or in flagging warmer ones . At the time of its movement
g02-059-04.jpg	the heart becomes generally constricted , its walls thicken ,
g02-059-05.jpg	its ventricles decrease in volume and it expels its
g02-059-06.jpg	content of blood , appearing paler in so doing in animals
g02-059-07.jpg	such as serpents , frogs , and the like .
g02-062-00.jpg	At one and the same time , therefore , occur the beat
g02-062-01.jpg	of the apex , the thickening of the heart walls , and
g02-062-02.jpg	the forcible expulsion of their contained blood by the
g02-062-03.jpg	contraction of the ventricles . Going on in Chapter Three
g02-062-04.jpg	to the movement of the arteries , likewise gauged from
g02-062-05.jpg	the dissections of living animals , Harvey noted that
g02-062-06.jpg	contraction of the heart and the apex beat occur in
g02-062-07.jpg	systole , simultaneously with dilatation of the arteries

g03-000-01.jpg	Yet in spite of the fact that his ideas did his
g03-000-02.jpg	business no good George would never conceal them .
g03-000-03.jpg	He was a socialist and believed in the right
g03-000-04.jpg	of the working class to control their own destiny , and
g03-000-05.jpg	said so . Being a craftsman and a skilled man ,
g03-000-06.jpg	George won many prizes , and though some people
g03-000-07.jpg	would have nothing to do with him , others
g03-000-08.jpg	would , and the comrades helped in many
g03-000-09.jpg	ways .
g03-004-00.jpg	When eventually the ovens were fixed at the new shop , the tremen-
g03-004-01.jpg	dously hard work was if anything intensified . George used to
g03-004-02.jpg	mix 100 stone of bread in 12 hours , and Kate served in the
g03-004-03.jpg	shop , which was open from 8 o'clock in the morning to
g03-004-04.jpg	12 o'clock at night . At that time pastries and buns
g03-004-05.jpg	were sold at 32 pieces for one shilling .
g03-032-00.jpg	Soon they were good enough to sing at meetings .
g03-032-01.jpg	One of the helpful by-products was that
g03-032-02.jpg	they were able to obtain some respectable
g03-032-03.jpg	clothing , with which they wore a white tie
g03-032-04.jpg	and Red Flag badge , thus presenting a much
g03-032-05.jpg	better appearance . Later , on many a sunny Sunday
g03-032-06.jpg	evening , when George went to speak at Malin Bridge ,
g03-032-07.jpg	they would be there to begin the meeting .
g03-040-00.jpg	As they became known the Choir went to working-
g03-040-01.jpg	men's clubs , to Conisborough on cheap trips to
g03-040-02.jpg	sing to the miners , and sang for other organisations such
g03-040-03.jpg	as the Bakers' Union , for whom they went on Satur-
g03-040-04.jpg	day evenings to the Corner Pin Hotel , to rally
g03-040-05.jpg	the members . The B.S.P. also rented pleasant rooms
g03-040-06.jpg	on West Street , where a successful Sunday
g03-040-07.jpg	school was held .
g03-043-00.jpg	One of the students was young
g03-043-01.jpg	George , and another the dark-haired
g03-043-02.jpg	little granddaughter of Charlie Grant .
g03-043-03.jpg	George often spoke at the Sunday school .
g03-043-04.jpg	He christened the babies . Also , when
g03-043-05.jpg	called upon to do so , he would officiate
g03-043-06.jpg	at funerals . Religion was one of his pet
g03-043-07.jpg	subjects , for being well acquainted
g03-043-08.jpg	with the Bible , which he had
g03-043-09.jpg	read in prison where it was the
g03-043-10.jpg	only book they were allowed ,
g03-049-00.jpg	Although his ideas were diametrically opposed
g03-049-01.jpg	to those of parsons he got on wonderfully well
g03-049-02.jpg	with them , particularly those who , like the Rev.
g03-049-03.jpg	Conrad Noel , the eloquent leader of
g03-049-04.jpg	the Church Socialist League , genuinely advocated
g03-049-05.jpg	socialism . With such men , who had the
g03-049-06.jpg	courage of their convictions and their
g03-049-07.jpg	Christianity , common ground could be found .
g03-052-00.jpg	There was no abatement in political
g03-052-01.jpg	work . The British Socialist Party endea-
g03-052-02.jpg	voured to get more socialist members sent to the
g03-052-03.jpg	Council , and to Parliament , being deter-
g03-052-04.jpg	mined and obdurate in their attitude that
g03-052-05.jpg	their candidate must go forward in the
g03-052-06.jpg	elections . In the Sheffield Trades and Labour
g03-052-07.jpg	Council meeting on October 16 , 1912 , George
g03-052-08.jpg	had said , ' Mr. Barton would go to the poll .
g03-052-09.jpg	Just as the Labour Party had fought the
g03-052-10.jpg	Liberals , they were going to fight the Labour
g03-064-00.jpg	Alf Barton , who in 1911 was presented
g03-064-01.jpg	with a book on the life of Marx ,
g03-064-02.jpg	and a gold purse in recognition of his
g03-064-03.jpg	work for the movement , was later
g03-064-04.jpg	known to say that it was not ne-
g03-064-05.jpg	cessary to understand Marxism in order to
g03-064-06.jpg	understand socialism , though at this time
g03-064-07.jpg	he was a keen member of the B.S.P. .
g04-022-00.jpg	After the First World War , 1914 , I did not visit
g04-022-01.jpg	Germany for ten years , by which time in
g04-022-02.jpg	1924 I was in a different parish in Surrey .
g04-022-03.jpg	Towards the end of my five and a half years'
g04-022-04.jpg	incumbency I was asked if I would start
g04-022-05.jpg	a village choral society and conduct it .
g04-022-06.jpg	This opened up a new interest , and we plunged
g04-022-07.jpg	into it .
g04-043-00.jpg	But what a change from the dear little old church
g04-043-01.jpg	at Tatsfield to the great modern church of St. Mark's
g04-043-02.jpg	at Purley . One felt at Tatsfield that , small as the
g04-043-03.jpg	church was , it had its own atmosphere , and for centuries
g04-043-04.jpg	had been a House of Prayer . I could not but feel the
g04-043-05.jpg	chilliness of the new church , beautiful as it was and is .
g04-043-06.jpg	When we had found a group of people who gladly
g04-043-07.jpg	co-operated , we made the little side chapel a place
g04-043-08.jpg	of daily prayer .
g04-048-00.jpg	I suggested to the congregation that it needed
g04-048-01.jpg	warming up by constant prayer and worship , and we
g04-048-02.jpg	found many to help . Gifts of candlesticks and
g04-048-03.jpg	stained-glass lancet windows - finally a new altar -
g04-048-04.jpg	helped to furnish the chapel as a little sanctuary
g04-048-05.jpg	for prayer and quiet . In time we received similar
g04-048-06.jpg	gifts for the High Altar , and large East and West
g04-048-07.jpg	windows .
g04-052-00.jpg	It was very interesting to have the privilege of filling
g04-052-01.jpg	such a beautiful building with suitable fittings ; I made
g04-052-02.jpg	a rule that all gifts should be submitted for approval to
g04-052-03.jpg	the architect , himself a fine artist . It is quite possible
g04-052-04.jpg	to put beautiful things into a beautiful church
g04-052-05.jpg	and yet spoil the building with ornaments unsui-
g04-052-06.jpg	table to the environs .
g04-068-00.jpg	Meanwhile in Purley there was much activity and much
g04-068-01.jpg	co-operation especially with the other Christian communities .
g04-068-02.jpg	At a large public meeting we launched the project known as the
g04-068-03.jpg	' Coulsdon and Purley Patriotic Fund ' in whose counsels and committees
g04-068-04.jpg	I found myself deeply involved . At first , the main work was to help
g04-068-05.jpg	wives and relations of the soldiers to get their ' Separation '
g04-068-06.jpg	allowances , but soon , alas ! , as casualties began and increased
g04-068-07.jpg	in the winter of 1914 and 1915 the matter of War Pensions
g04-068-08.jpg	became very urgent , and I was asked to be Chairman
g04-068-09.jpg	of the Committee in Coulsdon and Purley .
g04-072-00.jpg	Indeed , for the next seventeen years , during my time at
g04-072-01.jpg	Purley , and from 1922 at Surbiton , I was continuously
g04-072-02.jpg	Chairman of the local War Pensions Committee . This
g04-072-03.jpg	task involved a very great deal of detailed work for
g04-072-04.jpg	the Committee . We had a splendid body of local residents ,
g04-072-05.jpg	and a series of excellent Honorary Secretaries . Our
g04-072-06.jpg	Committee met once a week in the evenings , and
g04-072-07.jpg	included professional men from every walk of
g04-072-08.jpg	life .
g07-000b-00.jpg	When he saw Trelawny's printed letter , Lord Sidney wrote
g07-000b-01.jpg	to Douglas Kinnaird saying that it was incorrect
g07-000b-02.jpg	throughout . He had no sooner heard from Count Gamba
g07-000b-03.jpg	and Fletcher that Byron would have wished his
g07-000b-04.jpg	body to return to England than that course was
g07-000b-05.jpg	' immediately carried into effect ' - not in spite of himself
g07-000b-06.jpg	and Sir Frederick Stoven , but with their perfect con-
g07-000b-07.jpg	currence , while ' General Adam was at Corfu the whole
g07-000b-08.jpg	time and # never interfered in the slightest
g07-000b-09.jpg	degree about the matter ' .
g07-079a-00.jpg	Their friendship for Augusta became rather
g07-079a-01.jpg	hollow , and the news that Byron had left
g07-079a-02.jpg	her practically all his money caused it to
g07-079a-03.jpg	crumble to oblivion . Though Lady Byron
g07-079a-04.jpg	knew perfectly well that Byron , as early
g07-079a-05.jpg	as the year of their wedding , 1815 , had
g07-079a-06.jpg	made a will in Augusta's favour , she had
g07-079a-07.jpg	evidently not passed on that information ;
g07-079a-08.jpg	and it came as an appalling surprise to
g07-079a-09.jpg	Captain Byron that he had been left
g07-079a-10.jpg	without the fortune that would keep up the
g07-079a-11.jpg	title .
m01-049-00.jpg	He rose from his breakfast-nook bench
m01-049-01.jpg	and came into the livingroom , where
m01-049-02.jpg	Heather and Steve stood aghast at
m01-049-03.jpg	his entrance . He came , almost falling
m01-049-04.jpg	forward in an ungainly shuffle , neck
m01-049-05.jpg	thrust out , arms dangling loosely .
m01-049-06.jpg	Then , abruptly , he drew himself up
m01-049-07.jpg	and walked on the very tips of
m01-049-08.jpg	his toes . He stretched his arms
m01-049-09.jpg	over his head and yawned agape ,
m01-049-10.jpg	drawing-in great breaths that
m01-049-11.jpg	became great sighs of ecstacy .
m01-060-00.jpg	" They have come ! " he said reverently , gripping his
m01-060-01.jpg	hands together between his knees and leaning
m01-060-02.jpg	forward . " Isn't it a glorious thing ! Long awaited
m01-060-03.jpg	transcendent event , the exalted desire of all
m01-060-04.jpg	mankind through all ages ! The Kingdom of the
m01-060-05.jpg	Mind is at hand ! " He turned beaming eyes
m01-060-06.jpg	upward and shook his head slowly from
m01-060-07.jpg	side to side .
m01-079-00.jpg	A superfluous precaution for there was no other car
m01-079-01.jpg	abroad ; and no pedestrian to cross his path nor to wait
m01-079-02.jpg	at an intersection for the light to change . At his
m01-079-03.jpg	apartment he garaged his car and then stood
m01-079-04.jpg	listening in the night . Listening in vain . For the
m01-079-05.jpg	earth had lost its life-tempo , as the heart
m01-079-06.jpg	loses its beat in death .
m01-084-00.jpg	Deadly stillness , deadly portent !
m01-084-01.jpg	Steve awakened early and switched on
m01-084-02.jpg	the radio , which he kept tuned to CBO.
m01-084-03.jpg	The set lighted-up but gave only a low
m01-084-04.jpg	buzzing sound . He had just finished
m01-084-05.jpg	shaving when it came on , with a flat
m01-084-06.jpg	voice repeating : " This is BBC calling
m01-084-07.jpg	... this is BBC calling ... "
m01-095-00.jpg	Coming around the great mass of the Chateau
m01-095-01.jpg	Laurier , he braked to a screeching stop . A
m01-095-02.jpg	flying saucer was tilting and dipping over
m01-095-03.jpg	the War Memorial . There was a deep
m01-095-04.jpg	whirring sound , and a high-pitched hissing
m01-095-05.jpg	overtone that sang in his ears with an
m01-095-06.jpg	almost painful sharpness . He reversed and
m01-095-07.jpg	turned back on McKenzie Avenue .
m01-104-00.jpg	" The Thetans , " he said , " are presumably here to
m01-104-01.jpg	take charge , as it were , of the minds of the
m01-104-02.jpg	people - who are probably falling all over them-
m01-104-03.jpg	selves in their zeal to get their orders and to carry
m01-104-04.jpg	them out . Just what these orders will be , we don't
m01-104-05.jpg	know . Now , because of prior hypnosis we have es-
m01-104-06.jpg	caped Thetan subjugation . This time . But we no
m01-104-07.jpg	longer have any immunity .
m01-110-00.jpg	There can be little doubt that if the
m01-110-01.jpg	Thetans discover our mental independence
m01-110-02.jpg	they will promptly give us their hypnotic
m01-110-03.jpg	treatment . If we can avoid undue
m01-110-04.jpg	prominence , it may be that we can
m01-110-05.jpg	move about pretty freely without
m01-110-06.jpg	detection . If we can - well , then we
m01-110-07.jpg	may be able to promote our own
m01-110-08.jpg	interests . What those interests
m01-110-09.jpg	are , beyond personal security ,
m01-110-10.jpg	I haven't a clue ; but , who knows ,
m01-110-11.jpg	we may form the nucleus around ...
m01-121-00.jpg	There is just a hope that we may uncover
m01-121-01.jpg	some weakness , and find a way of fighting
m01-121-02.jpg	back at them . " Heather agreed , and suggested
m01-121-03.jpg	that they use Dan as a specimen demonstra-
m01-121-04.jpg	ting how the Thetan machinations had been
m01-121-05.jpg	working out . It occurred to Steve that this may
m01-121-06.jpg	not have been entirely an objective suggestion
m01-121-07.jpg	on her part ; but he thought it a good idea
m01-121-08.jpg	nevertheless .
m01-125-00.jpg	So they proceeded to see if the coast
m01-125-01.jpg	was clear . The street was quiet and
m01-125-02.jpg	deserted , and there were neither sight
m01-125-03.jpg	nor sound of flying saucers . So they
m01-125-04.jpg	ventured forth and made their way on
m01-125-05.jpg	foot to Dan's house . Dan came
m01-125-06.jpg	to the door at their ring but neglected
m01-125-07.jpg	to offer any greeting . He was deeply
m01-125-08.jpg	preoccupied , and it seemed that the
m01-125-09.jpg	ringing of a doorbell was to him
m01-125-10.jpg	a new and strange phenomenon .
m01-131-00.jpg	When he finally beckoned to them to enter , the action
m01-131-01.jpg	gave the impression of having been thought out and
m01-131-02.jpg	decided upon . Inside they sat down unbidden , while
m01-131-03.jpg	Dan paced the floor . He seemed completely unaware
m01-131-04.jpg	of their presence . They just stared at him , turning
m01-131-05.jpg	their heads like tennis spectators as he walked up and
m01-131-06.jpg	down , up and down .
m01-136-00.jpg	His whole attitude was a mixture of
m01-136-01.jpg	impatience pending an awaited
m01-136-02.jpg	communication and of a vague
m01-136-03.jpg	perplexity respecting his surroundings
m01-136-04.jpg	and the purpose he was to serve .
m01-136-05.jpg	Finally , being so obviously on their own ,
m01-136-06.jpg	Heather and Steve tried to make themselves
m01-136-07.jpg	at home . Steve switched on Dan's
m01-136-08.jpg	powerful , world-wide radio and systematically
m01-136-09.jpg	turned the tuning knob through all the
m01-136-10.jpg	tuning points of the world's great radio
m01-149-00.jpg	They followed him to a city bus stop on Carling Avenue , where
m01-149-01.jpg	he waited . The bus stop was a deserted island on an empty street .
m01-149-02.jpg	But not for long , for soon pedestrians and cars flocked upon
m01-149-03.jpg	the Avenue from its many tributary streets . It might have
m01-149-04.jpg	been a normal business-day bustle , except for two anomalies .
m01-149-05.jpg	First , it was Sunday morning ; and , second , everyone
m01-149-06.jpg	walked , or drove , or waited as a person possessed of
m01-149-07.jpg	a single all-exclusive purpose .
m02-048-00.jpg	Then he would go back to Plato for a final spell of
m02-048-01.jpg	real days and would return to New York in late
m02-048-02.jpg	January or early February . Angelina might be a
m02-048-03.jpg	little sorry if we were not back for Christmas
m02-048-04.jpg	as arranged , but he consoled himself by
m02-048-05.jpg	thinking that he and Angelina would have
m02-048-06.jpg	plenty of time together in the future . And
m02-048-07.jpg	Heaven alone knew when , if ever , he would be
m02-048-08.jpg	back on Moon again , and able to do
m02-048-09.jpg	research at first hand into matters on which
m02-048-10.jpg	the future of everyone , including Angelina , depended ...
m02-055-00.jpg	They had been married for six years , but the
m02-055-01.jpg	salary raise , on the expectation of which they
m02-055-02.jpg	had done so , had not materialised . " Do you
m02-055-03.jpg	know , I had to send back our bedroom
m02-055-04.jpg	furniture in the second year , " she moaned . She
m02-055-05.jpg	had contacts in political circles , a school-
m02-055-06.jpg	friend of hers having married Lester Peron ,
m02-055-07.jpg	a Mocrat Senator with a seat on the
m02-055-08.jpg	( literally ) all-powerful Rocket Release
m02-055-09.jpg	Board .
m02-055-10.jpg	Hostettler
m02-059-00.jpg	Sometimes she took Harry around with her , but
m02-059-01.jpg	never her husband , a fact he accepted as inevitable . " I guess
m02-059-02.jpg	Sally made a mistake about me , " he said one
m02-059-03.jpg	evening , when he had been left to cook his own meal .
m02-059-04.jpg	All Sally's relations were 4makrodeb now , but Tom
m02-059-05.jpg	was a Static Mib , the middle-income-bracket equivalent
m02-059-06.jpg	to 4sub-lil on the lower .
m02-066-00.jpg	All Aristotle was excited at the time , not by the prospect of the
m02-066-01.jpg	U.S. President's visit , but by a great storm in the photo-
m02-066-02.jpg	sphere of the sun . A matter which on Earth would hardly
m02-066-03.jpg	penetrate beyond the minds of astronomers was of general
m02-066-04.jpg	interest to the Mos , doubtless because their habitat is
m02-066-05.jpg	not submerged beneath a deep natural atmosphere .
m02-069-00.jpg	One wondered if this greater awareness of the physical cosmos might
m02-069-01.jpg	with time instil the reverence which , on Earth , nature inspires ,
m02-069-02.jpg	especially when one reflected that the rockets over which Mr. Peron's
m02-069-03.jpg	Board presided had it in their power permanently to warp the
m02-069-04.jpg	solar system . True enough , such ultimate weapons had not been
m02-069-05.jpg	used in the last few wars , but it seemed very probable
m02-069-06.jpg	that they would be in the next one , Moon and her
m02-069-07.jpg	allies being more inferior than formerly to W.C.U. in the
m02-069-08.jpg	weapons pronounced conventional .
m02-072-00.jpg	Lester was not home yet from his formidable
m02-072-01.jpg	duties and his wife , in the manner of middle-brow

m02-087-02.jpg	openness and freshness , though perhaps not the same
m02-087-03.jpg	maturity . One remembered that he was a lawyer
m02-087-04.jpg	by training , and suspected that the points he made
m02-087-05.jpg	so sharply in international politics were as abstract
m02-087-06.jpg	to him as those a lawyer makes in a court
m02-087-07.jpg	of law .
m02-095-00.jpg	The political life of Aristotle looked more and more
m02-095-01.jpg	like a masquerade of business interests in dis-
m02-095-02.jpg	guise which , far from attracting the allegiance
m02-095-03.jpg	of free men everywhere , could only repel them .
m02-095-04.jpg	Then what of the cultural life ? Did this per-
m02-095-05.jpg	haps nurture a genuinely civilizing impulse
m02-095-06.jpg	which might in time become social fact
m02-095-07.jpg	and counteract the obsession with economics
m02-095-08.jpg	which had grown up during the Moon's
m02-095-09.jpg	first two centuries ?
m02-109-00.jpg	Stepping out in their white shorts , they looked glad enough
m02-109-01.jpg	to be diverted , however , with the single exception of one
m02-109-02.jpg	worried little man-student who kept getting out of
m02-109-03.jpg	step . He looked as if nothing Moke and his
m02-109-04.jpg	minions could do to him would ever make him
m02-109-05.jpg	GO ; but the reason probably lay in elementary
m02-109-06.jpg	neurosis and not in some eruption from those
m02-109-07.jpg	deeper layers in the human psyche which are
m02-109-08.jpg	trans-economic .
m02-112-00.jpg	So once again the metaphysics were depressing ,
m02-112-01.jpg	and in absolute contrast to the physical display .
m02-112-02.jpg	Mos have an un-American love of parades , and
m02-112-03.jpg	these young ones , on parade for jobs which they
m02-112-04.jpg	had to get to pay off their college bills , were naturally
m02-112-05.jpg	putting their best foot forward .
m03-006-00.jpg	' Something's up , ' said Lord Undertone ,
m03-006-01.jpg	carefully casual . ' The servants are all on
m03-006-02.jpg	edge ... did you notice ? And the mules
m03-006-03.jpg	didn't seem to want to get off the raft . '
m03-006-04.jpg	He peered as it were into the dark secrets
m03-006-05.jpg	of the jungle . ' Think there's Indians
m03-006-06.jpg	about ? ' It was most certainly an eerie
m03-006-07.jpg	night , exceptionally brilliant and strange ,
m03-006-08.jpg	for in the proximity of the mountains ,
m03-006-09.jpg	whose presence I could almost smell ,
m03-013-00.jpg	' Impressive , ' Lord Undertone said , gazing reverently
m03-013-01.jpg	on the cosmic handiwork . ' All those stars . But I'm
m03-013-02.jpg	a bit earthbound tonight , Trout . I've got a queer
m03-013-03.jpg	feeling , like I always get when something
m03-013-04.jpg	sensational's going to happen . There's things lurking
m03-013-05.jpg	if you ask me . Might be jaguar , might be ...
m03-013-06.jpg	head-shrinkers .
m03-020-00.jpg	Hope I die kind of composed , Trout . I mean you can't
m03-020-01.jpg	imagine the Christian martyrs twisting and shrieking ,
m03-020-02.jpg	no matter how bad it felt , the fire you know , or a
m03-020-03.jpg	lion munching , or arrows where it hurts most . Or
m03-020-04.jpg	can you . Look over there . ' He pointed to the
m03-020-05.jpg	shadows beyond the river . ' Something moved . '
m03-033-00.jpg	' Bottle-Foot , my lord . ' ' Bottle-Foot ? ' His lordship
m03-033-01.jpg	may have thought I had become unbalanced
m03-033-02.jpg	through fear . ' A character Mr Gilberto mentioned
m03-033-03.jpg	to other day , my lord . A being of whom
m03-033-04.jpg	the forest Indians are said to be mortally
m03-033-05.jpg	afraid , with a hoof shaped like the heel
m03-033-06.jpg	of a bottle . If your lordship will excuse me
m03-033-07.jpg	a moment ... '
m03-110-00.jpg	Sally and of course Mrs Septimus , for surely
m03-110-01.jpg	Mr Septimus stood in the same case as
m03-110-02.jpg	myself ? But was it so ? I allowed myself
m03-110-03.jpg	to entertain for an instant the idea , the
m03-110-04.jpg	strange , the unwelcome , the almost
m03-110-05.jpg	inconceivable idea , that Ariadne's arrival
m03-110-06.jpg	would be inopportune ; and with the idea came
m03-110-07.jpg	a somewhat vulgar impulse , which I refused ,
m03-110-08.jpg	to watch Mr Septimus more closely , Mrs
m03-110-09.jpg	Caine too and Mr Gilberto who would ...
m03-114-00.jpg	But all three were to the casual
m03-114-01.jpg	observation I permitted myself unruffled ;
m03-114-02.jpg	Mr Septimus reserved and certainly very
m03-114-03.jpg	thoughtful , but that was his habit . Indeed
m03-114-04.jpg	we were all invaded by a most tranquil
m03-114-05.jpg	mood . Even the Indian servants relaxed , knowing ,
m03-114-06.jpg	so Mr Gilberto told us , that the wild and
m03-114-07.jpg	savage tribes never approached this region : at
m03-114-08.jpg	any rate they remained with us , perhaps
m03-114-09.jpg	for such protection as our presence , or Mrs
m03-118-00.jpg	But after what Mrs Caine had said it was never
m03-118-01.jpg	far from our minds that at any moment we were
m03-118-02.jpg	to receive a summons . I could see that Mr Septimus
m03-118-03.jpg	was impatient for it . This afternoon , then , we climbed
m03-118-04.jpg	a promontory , a mass of clean rock crowned with
m03-118-05.jpg	trees and bushes , that stood well out over the lake .
m04-030-00.jpg	" Good-bye , Dai , " said Morfydd , smiling from the bottom step .
m04-030-01.jpg	" Good-bye , Morfydd . " He sought to enfold her in his arms . But he was too late .
m04-030-02.jpg	She was already up the bus steps , and the bus was away . And Morfydd Owen
m04-030-03.jpg	waving , unkissed , from the window . And Dai , on the pavement , knowing in his
m04-030-04.jpg	heart that Morfydd was leaving him as surely as she was leaving Dinas .
m04-038-00.jpg	So the bus set out for Llangrwl . But it never reached there ! Somewhere ,
m04-038-01.jpg	on those fifteen miles of mountain roads , it disappeared from the earthly
m04-038-02.jpg	scene . The first intimation that all was not well came when a
m04-038-03.jpg	Mr. Isaiah Roberts , landlord of The Traveller's Joy , rang up the
m04-038-04.jpg	Dinas Motor Omnibus Co. to ask what had happened to their
m04-038-05.jpg	damn bus .
m04-043-00.jpg	" Left here all right , " said Ifor . " Two-thirty-five , on the dot . " " It's
m04-043-01.jpg	supposed to leave at two-twenty . " " Who says so ? " " Your timetable . "
m04-043-02.jpg	" Don't want to take too much notice of those old timetables , " Ifor said ,
m04-043-03.jpg	reasonably . " Start running punctual and where are you ? People get
m04-043-04.jpg	left behind , isn't it ? Very exasperating for one and all . "
m04-061-00.jpg	" And what are you going to do about it ? " Tendentious , Mr. Roberts sounded .
m04-061-01.jpg	" What do you want me to do ? Send out a sheriff's posse , is it ? " No sense
m04-061-02.jpg	of humour , that Isaiah . He banged down the receiver . Very uncivil . Dropped
m04-061-03.jpg	the mask , now , Ifor did . " Dai Pugh , " he bellowed . " Leap on your bicycle
m04-061-04.jpg	and scour the countryside between here and The Traveller's Joy .
m04-072-00.jpg	The two-twenty to Llangrwl has failed to
m04-072-01.jpg	complete her mission . " Paled , did Dai . For the
m04-072-02.jpg	two-twenty carried , for him , a cargo more
m04-072-03.jpg	precious than jewels . Though Mofydd Owen
m04-072-04.jpg	was , as he feared , departed out of his life ,
m04-072-05.jpg	he still loved her dearly . Already , even
m04-072-06.jpg	as with trembling fingers he fastened his
m04-072-07.jpg	trouser clips , he was seeing her lying in
m04-072-08.jpg	some dreadful ravine , or beset by
m04-072-09.jpg	robbers , or being whisked off to Emergency
m04-072-10.jpg	Ward 10 .
m04-078-00.jpg	But even his imagination , luckily for him ,
m04-078-01.jpg	did not visualise the awful truth - that
m04-078-02.jpg	Morfyyd Owen was already qualifying for
m04-078-03.jpg	the title of " First Woman to Enter Space . "
m04-078-04.jpg	" Where are we going , Mam ? " inquired little
m04-078-05.jpg	Cadwallader when his child mind grasped
m04-078-06.jpg	the fact that the green earth was falling
m04-078-07.jpg	away at a rate of knots .
m04-081-00.jpg	Where indeed ? Megan Thomas spoke sharply
m04-081-01.jpg	to the conductor , demanding an explanation .
m04-081-02.jpg	But nonplussed , the conductor was . A
m04-081-03.jpg	good man , mind ; knew his job . But out of
m04-081-04.jpg	depth in this particular instance . Fingered
m04-081-05.jpg	his ticket-punch nervously . Peered out of
m04-081-06.jpg	the window . Went and consulted the driver .
m04-081-07.jpg	" Where are we going ? " he echoed Cadwallader .
m04-081-08.jpg	" Damned if I know , boy , " said the driver .
m04-081-09.jpg	" But something very untoward has
m04-081-10.jpg	happened , if you ask me . "
m04-093-00.jpg	Immersed in the Dinas Advertiser , was the
m04-093-01.jpg	Rev. Edwards . Now he put down his paper ,
m04-093-02.jpg	folded it , and glanced idly out of the
m04-093-03.jpg	window . Looked again , eyes starting from
m04-093-04.jpg	his head . " God bless my immortal soul , "
m04-093-05.jpg	he cried . " Never mind your immortal
m04-093-06.jpg	soul , " said Megan Thomas tartly .
m04-093-07.jpg	" Here we are traversing the heavens at the
m04-093-08.jpg	very moment when we should be
m04-093-09.jpg	running into Llangrwl bus station .
m04-100-00.jpg	And no one doing the first thing about
m04-100-01.jpg	it . " Stung , the conductor was . " What you
m04-100-02.jpg	expect me to do ? " he inquired , bitter .
m04-100-03.jpg	" Radio Flying Control at London Airport ,
m04-100-04.jpg	is it ? " " Mutual recriminations will get
m04-100-05.jpg	us nowhere , " boomed the Rev. Edwards .
m04-100-06.jpg	" It's all very well , " commented
m04-100-07.jpg	Mr. Hayball from the back seat .
m04-107-00.jpg	" But Eth and me wanted to be
m04-107-01.jpg	at the Youth Hostel before dark . "
m04-107-02.jpg	Morfydd Owen was silent . But she
m04-107-03.jpg	looked down at the fast-disappearing
m04-107-04.jpg	earth , and it seemed to her that she
m04-107-05.jpg	would never see her Dai again . And
m04-107-06.jpg	though half an hour ago she had
m04-107-07.jpg	regarded this possibility with
m04-107-08.jpg	fortitude , it now filled her with
m04-107-09.jpg	dismay . Quietly she began to
m04-107-10.jpg	weep ...
m04-113-00.jpg	Dai , meanwhile , was pedalling
m04-113-01.jpg	furiously on the road . Not a sign of
m04-113-02.jpg	the bus . He passed The Traveller's
m04-113-03.jpg	Joy . At last he caught up Mr. Roberts ,
m04-113-04.jpg	walking very dogged towards Llangrwl .
m04-113-05.jpg	" Afternoon , Mr. Roberts , " he called , polite ,
m04-113-06.jpg	as he shot past . His spirits were rising .
m04-113-07.jpg	He had seen no sign of an accident .
m04-113-08.jpg	Therefore Mr. Roberts must have been mistaken .
m04-113-09.jpg	He would find the bus safe and sound in
m04-113-10.jpg	Llangrwl , and his dear Morfydd quietly
m04-123-00.jpg	But disappointment awaited him . A
m04-123-01.jpg	restive queue of people in the bus station ,
m04-123-02.jpg	waiting to be transported to Dinas . And
m04-123-03.jpg	when he went to Morfydd's house , all
m04-123-04.jpg	he found was Morfydd's mam , working
m04-123-05.jpg	herself up proper ... Getting dark , now .
m04-123-06.jpg	The conductor switched on the lights .
m04-123-07.jpg	The beleaguered passengers peered out of
m04-123-08.jpg	the windows . Little to be seen , only a
m04-123-09.jpg	few lone stars , and the distant earth
m04-123-10.jpg	brooding in her shroud of mist .
m04-131-00.jpg	Megan Thomas sat tight-lipped , nursing
m04-131-01.jpg	the sleeping Cadwallader . Driver and
m04-131-02.jpg	conductor peered ahead into nothingness .
m04-131-03.jpg	On the back seat Stan Hayball embraced
m04-131-04.jpg	his Eth . Morfydd thought of Dai . The
m04-131-05.jpg	Rev. Edwards , standing at the front ,
m04-131-06.jpg	looked at his forlorn flock . " What
m04-131-07.jpg	about a verse or two of Cwm Rhondda ? "
m04-131-08.jpg	he suggested hopefully .
m04-138-00.jpg	They looked at him , sullen . His heart
m04-138-01.jpg	sank . If the Welsh found the situation
m04-138-02.jpg	too desperate for singing , then the
m04-138-03.jpg	situation , he realised , must be desperate
m04-138-04.jpg	indeed . But suddenly they were roused
m04-138-05.jpg	from their lethargy . Something was
m04-138-06.jpg	approaching , faster , faster , a tearing
m04-138-07.jpg	hurrying blur that was past and gone
m04-138-08.jpg	in a moment , followed by a great
m04-138-09.jpg	rush of sound . They waved frantically .
m04-231-00.jpg	" Do as I say , driver . " Very stern , the reverend
m04-231-01.jpg	gentleman was . So the driver peep-peeped as
m04-231-02.jpg	through empty space . " Thank you , " the Rev.
m04-231-03.jpg	Edwards said courteously . " Secondly , we must
m04-231-04.jpg	pool and ration our supplies of food , if any . "
m04-231-05.jpg	He looked at Price the Provisions , who was nursing
m04-231-06.jpg	a great basket .
m04-238-00.jpg	" Now , who has any food ? " he asked hopefully .
m04-238-01.jpg	Stared back did Price the Provisions , unwinking .
m04-238-02.jpg	" Mr. Price , I think you may be able to help us here , "
m04-238-03.jpg	said the Rev. Edwards . Price shook his head .
m04-238-04.jpg	" Intended for Plas Newydd , this lot is . Paid for ,
m04-238-05.jpg	too . " He folded his arms protectively over the basket .
m04-246-00.jpg	Mutinous dog , thought the Rev. Edwards , who hadn't
m04-246-01.jpg	enjoyed himself so much since reading Treasure
m04-246-02.jpg	Island . " What have you got in that basket , Price ? "
m04-246-03.jpg	he roared . Quelled , Mr. Price pulled out a grocery
m04-246-04.jpg	list , pushed his glasses up on his nose , and
m04-246-05.jpg	began to read . " Six loaves , four pounds butter ,
m04-246-06.jpg	two pounds marge , one tin pineapple , one York ham . "
m06-031-00.jpg	' But we - ' ' Stop your stupid talk , woman ! ' ' We are - '
m06-031-01.jpg	' Be silent , woman , and listen , ' Band Appa Bondi said .
m06-031-02.jpg	' We know much , ' repeated the Chief Captive . ' Some
m06-031-03.jpg	things we will tell you . All who make the journey from
m06-031-04.jpg	the Heavy World become changed . Some die . Most live
m06-031-05.jpg	and grow wings . Between the worlds are many strong
m06-031-06.jpg	rays , not seen or felt , which change our bodies .
m06-042-00.jpg	When you come here , when you come to the True
m06-042-01.jpg	World , you become a true human . The grub of the
m06-042-02.jpg	tigerfly is not a tigerfly until it changes . So humans
m06-042-03.jpg	change . ' ' I cannot know what he says , ' Haris said
m06-042-04.jpg	stubbornly , throwing himself down . But Lily-yo and
m06-042-05.jpg	Flor were listening .
m06-048-00.jpg	' To this True World , as you call it , we come to die , '
m06-048-01.jpg	Lily-yo said , doubtingly . The Captive with the
m06-048-02.jpg	fleshless jaw said , ' The grub of the tigerfly thinks
m06-048-03.jpg	it dies when it changes into a tigerfly . ' ' You are still
m06-048-04.jpg	young , ' said the Chief Captive . ' You begin newly here .
m06-048-05.jpg	Where are your souls ? ' Lily-yo and Flor looked at
m06-048-06.jpg	each other . In their flight from the 4wiltmilt they had
m06-048-07.jpg	heedlessly thrown down their souls .
m06-056-00.jpg	Haris had trampled on his . It was unthinkable !
m06-056-01.jpg	' You see . You needed them no more . You are still
m06-056-02.jpg	young . You may be able to have babies . Some of those
m06-056-03.jpg	babies may be born with wings . ' The Captive with
m06-056-04.jpg	the boneless arms added , ' Some may be born wrong ,
m06-056-05.jpg	as we are . Some may be born right . '
m06-067-00.jpg	' You are too foul to live ! ' Haris growled . ' Why are
m06-067-01.jpg	you not killed ? ' ' Because we know all things , ' the
m06-067-02.jpg	Chief Captive said . Suddenly his second head roused
m06-067-03.jpg	itself and declared , ' To be a good shape is not all
m06-067-04.jpg	in life . To know is also good . Because we cannot move
m06-067-05.jpg	well we can - think . This tribe of the True World
m06-067-06.jpg	is good and knows these things .
m06-076-00.jpg	So it lets us rule it . ' Flor and Lily-yo
m06-076-01.jpg	muttered together . ' Do you say that you poor
m06-076-02.jpg	Captives rule the True World ? ' Lily-yo asked
m06-076-03.jpg	at last . ' We do . ' ' Then why are you captives ? '
m06-076-04.jpg	The flyman with ear lobes and thumbs connected ,
m06-076-05.jpg	making his perpetual little gesture of protest ,
m06-076-06.jpg	spoke for the first time .
m06-083-00.jpg	' To rule is to serve , woman . Those who bear power
m06-083-01.jpg	are slaves to it . Only an outcast is free . Because
m06-083-02.jpg	we are Captives , we have the time to talk and
m06-083-03.jpg	think and plan and know . Those who know
m06-083-04.jpg	command the knives of others . ' ' No hurt will
m06-083-05.jpg	come to you , Lily-yo , ' Band Appa Bondi added .
m06-083-06.jpg	' You will live among us and enjoy your life free
m06-083-07.jpg	from harm . '
m06-091-00.jpg	' No ! ' the Chief Captive said with both mouths .
m06-091-01.jpg	' Before she can enjoy , Lily-yo and her companion
m06-091-02.jpg	Flor - this other man creature is plainly useless -
m06-091-03.jpg	must help our great plan . ' ' The invasion ? ' Bondi
m06-091-04.jpg	asked . ' What else ? Flor and Lily-yo , you arrive
m06-091-05.jpg	here at a good time . Memories of the Heavy World
m06-091-06.jpg	and its savage life are still fresh in you .
m06-098-00.jpg	We need such memories . So we ask you to go
m06-098-01.jpg	back there on a great plan we have . ' ' Go back ? '
m06-098-02.jpg	gasped Flor . ' Yes . We plan to attack the Heavy
m06-098-03.jpg	World . You must help to lead our force . ' The long
m06-098-04.jpg	afternoon of eternity wore on , that long golden road
m06-098-05.jpg	of an afternoon that would somewhere lead to
m06-098-06.jpg	everlasting night .
m06-106-00.jpg	Motion there was , but motion without event - except
m06-106-01.jpg	for those negligible events that seemed so large to
m06-106-02.jpg	the creatures participating in them . For Lily-yo , Flor
m06-106-03.jpg	and Haris there were many events . Chief of these was
m06-106-04.jpg	that they learned to fly properly . The pains associated
m06-106-05.jpg	with their wings soon died away as the wonderful
m06-106-06.jpg	new flesh and tendon strengthened . To sail up in the
m06-106-07.jpg	light gravity became an increasing delight - the ugly
m06-106-08.jpg	flopping movements of flymen on the Heavy World
m06-106-09.jpg	had no place here .
n01-000-00.jpg	Alastair was a bachelor . All his life he had
n01-000-01.jpg	been inclined to regard women as something
n01-000-02.jpg	which must necessarily be subordinated to his
n01-000-03.jpg	career . Now he realised that he was entrusting not only
n01-000-04.jpg	his own life , but Geoffrey's as well , to a strange girl
n01-000-05.jpg	whom he had never met and on whom after no more
n01-000-06.jpg	than a couple of telephone calls he was
n01-000-07.jpg	prepared to place complete reliance .
n01-004-00.jpg	It was a novel experience . Alastair was
n01-004-01.jpg	quite unable to explain why he should feel
n01-004-02.jpg	so much confidence in her . Once again
n01-004-03.jpg	she checked back her instructions . It was
n01-004-04.jpg	obvious that she did not fail to appreciate the
n01-004-05.jpg	faith which he was placing in her and
n01-004-06.jpg	was prepared to accept the responsibility .
n01-009-00.jpg	" Good luck , Air Marshal , " she said gently . " I'll
n01-009-01.jpg	be waiting for you at the Hotel Roma at six this
n01-009-02.jpg	evening - and I shall look forward to meeting you
n01-009-03.jpg	both at midnight . " They might have been
n01-009-04.jpg	arranging a supper party . Then she rang off .
n01-009-05.jpg	Alastair admitted that never in a not altogether
n01-009-06.jpg	uneventful life had he come across a girl who
n01-009-07.jpg	sounded so charming and appeared to be so
n01-009-08.jpg	efficient .
n01-020-00.jpg	For some reason the orderlies had forgotten
n01-020-01.jpg	to switch on the lights ; there was no colour -
n01-020-02.jpg	physical features were distinguishable solely by
n01-020-03.jpg	gradations of silvery greyness . Even the snow-
n01-020-04.jpg	capped summit of Mont Blanc , seven miles
n01-020-05.jpg	below , was not recognisable among the host
n01-020-06.jpg	of lower peaks . The screen of the air-to-air
n01-020-07.jpg	radar glowed . Occasionally minute spots
n01-020-08.jpg	flickered across its surface , but there was
n01-020-09.jpg	no permanent image .
n01-031-00.jpg	In the exceptional clarity he was even able to
n01-031-01.jpg	make a direct comparison between the radar
n01-031-02.jpg	image and the ground itself . Ahead lay the
n01-031-03.jpg	Plain of Lombardy ; to the right , Turin ; to the
n01-031-04.jpg	left , Milan . The directional angle of the
n01-031-05.jpg	scanner could be adjusted to cover any
n01-031-06.jpg	particular area within its range . Geoffrey
n01-031-07.jpg	turned the scale slowly to cover the
n01-031-08.jpg	ground immediately ahead .
n01-036-00.jpg	He was able to pick out towns , unrecognisable to the
n01-036-01.jpg	naked eye , obscured by the ground haze which even
n01-036-02.jpg	on the clearest night limited angular vision . He glanced
n01-036-03.jpg	at the speed recorder . It seemed almost incredible that
n01-036-04.jpg	the tiny white figure of 8.5 against which the needle
n01-036-05.jpg	was resting could really mean hundreds of knots .
n01-045-00.jpg	Now , as Alastair reduced the thrust , the
n01-045-01.jpg	pitch changed as the nose of the aircraft
n01-045-02.jpg	dipped slightly . The needle of the speed
n01-045-03.jpg	recorder swung gently through 8.0 , 7.0 , 6.0
n01-045-04.jpg	before coming to rest at 5.0 . " We're a bit
n01-045-05.jpg	ahead of time , " said Alastair . " We'll run
n01-045-06.jpg	in on minimum engine power . " Geoffrey
n01-045-07.jpg	smiled . Alastair talked of running in when
n01-045-08.jpg	they were still more than four hundred
n01-045-09.jpg	miles from their destination .
n01-052-00.jpg	They were nearing Modena . Geoffrey focused the radar scanner
n01-052-01.jpg	on the bridge over the Po , barely forty miles to port .
n01-052-02.jpg	He was able to trace the course of the river ; he
n01-052-03.jpg	thought he could recognise the route of N12 ,
n01-052-04.jpg	along which he had motored so desperately little
n01-052-05.jpg	more than twenty-four hours earlier . Since then
n01-052-06.jpg	he had flown to England , attended the vital
n01-052-07.jpg	conference in Bruce Denton's office , been whisked
n01-052-08.jpg	by special helicopter from the Horse Guards
n01-052-09.jpg	Parade to Boscombe Down , slept for six blessed
n01-052-10.jpg	refreshing hours and had now completed two-thirds
n01-052-11.jpg	of the journey back to the place where every
n01-052-12.jpg	indication pointed to Eve being held .
n01-057-00.jpg	Geoffrey set himself to consider the
n01-057-01.jpg	movements of the Bentley . It had passed
n01-057-02.jpg	him at the temporary bridge over the
n01-057-03.jpg	Tartaro at a few minutes past ten on the
n01-057-04.jpg	previous night . He worked out the distance
n01-057-05.jpg	on the presumption that its route had been
n01-057-06.jpg	through Florence and Rome and then
n01-057-07.jpg	across Italy via Foggia to Barletta .
n01-057-08.jpg	It came to just over six hundred
n01-057-09.jpg	miles .
n02-004-00.jpg	To Beryl , at least , this was anti-climax with a
n02-004-01.jpg	vengeance . She had expected to be met with violent
n02-004-02.jpg	reproaches - and here he was bland and smiling .
n02-004-03.jpg	But it did not take her long to realise that his mood
n02-004-04.jpg	was less pleasant than appeared on the surface .
n02-004-05.jpg	He told her nonchalantly , as he led the way to his
n02-004-06.jpg	own veranda , that he had taken the liberty of
n02-004-07.jpg	asking Jack - as a representative of the Vallin family -
n02-004-08.jpg	to come over and make the presentation in her stead .
n02-009-00.jpg	" I caught him just as he was going to the
n02-009-01.jpg	airport to meet Blanche , " he said . " As a matter
n02-009-02.jpg	of fact I'd asked him last night to deputise
n02-009-03.jpg	for me and fetch her . He brought her to the party
n02-009-04.jpg	too . They're both here . " " I didn't know she was
n02-009-05.jpg	coming back from Barbados so soon . " Beryl
n02-009-06.jpg	said the first thing that came into her head .
n02-028-00.jpg	Jack and Blanche were quick to sympathise , and to
n02-028-01.jpg	express their disgust at Sir John's abominable treatment
n02-028-02.jpg	of his guests . But Piers remained aloof , and when Beryl
n02-028-03.jpg	suggested having a second party , the following week , he
n02-028-04.jpg	poured cold water on the project . Everyone , he declared ,
n02-028-05.jpg	had had a thoroughly good time , and it would take them
n02-028-06.jpg	nearly to next week to settle down again . Meanwhile
n02-028-07.jpg	Hubert would have betaken himself and his well-
n02-028-08.jpg	earned gratuity to his native village at the
n02-028-09.jpg	north of the island .
n02-033-00.jpg	It was all over and done with .
n02-033-01.jpg	For the time being Beryl was content to let
n02-033-02.jpg	it go at that , but she resolved to have
n02-033-03.jpg	it out with Piers when a reasonable
n02-033-04.jpg	opportunity presented itself . He must
n02-033-05.jpg	learn that he could not treat her
n02-033-06.jpg	with injustice and contempt , ignoring
n02-033-07.jpg	her explanations as though he were
n02-033-08.jpg	a schoolmaster and she a small ,
n02-033-09.jpg	ignorant child .
n02-037-00.jpg	He gave her no chance of any private
n02-037-01.jpg	conversation that evening , for when
n02-037-02.jpg	Blanche and Jack left , he went with
n02-037-03.jpg	them . But next morning she insisted
n02-037-04.jpg	on his taking her out in the jeep -
n02-037-05.jpg	to find , if possible , Hubert and his
n02-037-06.jpg	relations , and tell them of
n02-037-07.jpg	her great disappointment at being
n02-037-08.jpg	held up in Balicou .
n02-040-00.jpg	With an air of resignation he sent Judy , his
n02-040-01.jpg	Boxer , to the back , and made room for her
n02-040-02.jpg	beside him . " Is that all you want to do ? "
n02-040-03.jpg	he asked , letting in the clutch . " No ; I want
n02-040-04.jpg	to make you understand just what happened
n02-040-05.jpg	about this Balicou trip , " she returned
n02-040-06.jpg	coldly . " I'm a little tired of being treated
n02-040-07.jpg	like an ineffective imbecile . "
n02-045-00.jpg	" And I'm heartily sick of being constantly called
n02-045-01.jpg	to account for my manners , " he retorted .
n02-045-02.jpg	" What have I done wrong now ? I cover up for
n02-045-03.jpg	you the best way I can by getting hold of Jack
n02-045-04.jpg	to make the presentation , I run the damned
n02-045-05.jpg	party to the best of my ability - saying the
n02-045-06.jpg	sugary things you ought to have been there
n02-045-07.jpg	to say - and all you can do is to find
n02-045-08.jpg	fault . "
n02-049-00.jpg	" It's your superior attitude that riles me . " Beryl was
n02-049-01.jpg	scarlet with annoyance . " How I happened to be marooned
n02-049-02.jpg	at Balicou doesn't interest you in the faintest degree . You
n02-049-03.jpg	look as though it was only what you expected of me ,
n02-049-04.jpg	as though I didn't care a hoot about letting Hubert
n02-049-05.jpg	and his pals down . "
n02-054-00.jpg	" As your employee it's not my business
n02-054-01.jpg	to understand all the whys and
n02-054-02.jpg	wherefores of your actions , " he said
n02-054-03.jpg	stiffly . " Still less to criticise you . "
n02-054-04.jpg	" Oh , drop that nonsense , Piers !
n02-054-05.jpg	Be yourself , " she exclaimed , with
n02-054-06.jpg	mounting exasperation . " Very well ! " He
n02-054-07.jpg	brought the jeep to a standstill in a rough
n02-054-08.jpg	path fringed and shaded by citrus trees .
n02-054-09.jpg	" If you want my true opinion I'll give it .
n02-062-00.jpg	You made some sort of a protest to Graybury .
n02-062-01.jpg	I'll give you credit for that . But you didn't press
n02-062-02.jpg	the matter because , very naturally , you were
n02-062-03.jpg	thoroughly enjoying Forrest's company in
n02-062-04.jpg	idyllic surroundings . " " How dare you say
n02-062-05.jpg	such a thing ? " she blazed . " For goodness'
n02-062-06.jpg	sake show a glimmer of reason , " was his
n02-062-07.jpg	equally indignant rejoinder .
n02-104-00.jpg	" I know . Absurd as it may seem , I didn't want
n02-104-01.jpg	you to think badly of me . " She turned away
n02-104-02.jpg	from him to fondle Judy , who , sensing something
n02-104-03.jpg	amiss , was nudging her in the endeavour to
n02-104-04.jpg	gain her attention . " The truth is that
n02-104-05.jpg	if I had absolutely insisted on sailing at the
n02-104-06.jpg	time originally arranged , Sir John would
n02-104-07.jpg	have had it in for Guy .
n02-109-00.jpg	You see , it was , apparently , through a mistake
n02-109-01.jpg	on Guy's part that we missed seeing the
n02-109-02.jpg	flamingoes our first morning on the island . "
n02-109-03.jpg	" What harm could possibly have come to Forrest
n02-109-04.jpg	through Sir John's nonsense ? " Piers could
n02-109-05.jpg	hardly have spoken with more contempt .
n02-109-06.jpg	A bully like that respects anyone who
n02-109-07.jpg	dares to stand up to him . "
n02-114-00.jpg	Beryl tried to suppress the thought that this was
n02-114-01.jpg	precisely the remark she had made to Guy .
n02-114-02.jpg	She said icily , " As you pride yourself on
n02-114-03.jpg	your knowledge of all the affairs of the
n02-114-04.jpg	island I needn't tell you that Sir John
n02-114-05.jpg	Graybury is one of Mr. Hewson's most
n02-114-06.jpg	important customers . " " So what ? You're not
n02-114-07.jpg	trying to say that Hewson would victimise
n02-114-08.jpg	Forrest for behaving with ordinary moral
n02-114-09.jpg	courage !
n02-120-00.jpg	He's quite capable of telling Sir John to take
n02-120-01.jpg	himself and his business to an unmention-
n02-120-02.jpg	able destination . " " There's a difference
n02-120-03.jpg	between what a senior and a junior
n02-120-04.jpg	partner can do , " was her quick reply .
n02-120-05.jpg	" What they can bring off ! I'll admit that .
n02-120-06.jpg	But Forrest might at least have tried . He's
n02-120-07.jpg	pretty spineless ! "
n02-127-00.jpg	" You think you could have carried more weight
n02-127-01.jpg	with Sir John ? " she enquired cuttingly .
n02-127-02.jpg	" For all your good opinion of yourself ,
n02-127-03.jpg	I doubt it . He's about as easy to push around
n02-127-04.jpg	as - as a grounded whale ! " He had to smile
n02-127-05.jpg	at that , but went on airily , " I'd have made
n02-127-06.jpg	an attempt to show my lady-love that I
n02-127-07.jpg	put her interests before my own .
n02-151-00.jpg	Their air of smiling somnolence showed them
n02-151-01.jpg	to have been guests at yesterday's
n02-151-02.jpg	celebrations , and their friendly welcome
n02-151-03.jpg	and warm sympathy , as she explained
n02-151-04.jpg	how she had come to miss the party ,
n02-151-05.jpg	made her send a complacent glance
n02-151-06.jpg	in Piers' direction . What a fuss-box the
n02-151-07.jpg	man was , she thought impatiently ,
n02-151-08.jpg	trying to worry her into the belief
n02-151-09.jpg	that her failure to appear at a function
n02-151-10.jpg	on the estate was a major error :
n02-154-00.jpg	And then she received a jolt . Old Hubert , standing
n02-154-01.jpg	beside her , his battered hat in his hand , his
n02-154-02.jpg	toothless mouth stretched in a wide grin , told her
n02-154-03.jpg	in halting 6patois that " 3Mistah Piers " had
n02-154-04.jpg	explained right at the start that " 3Mis' Beryl "
n02-154-05.jpg	would be 3" plenty , plenty sad " not to be back
n02-154-06.jpg	at the Villa in time .
n02-157-00.jpg	That it wouldn't be her fault at all . That
n02-157-01.jpg	she was a lady who , like her Uncle Charles ,
n02-157-02.jpg	took the highest pride in keeping her word . " I
n02-157-03.jpg	could see 3anudder 3t'ing , " he went on in a
n02-157-04.jpg	lower voice , his sunken black eyes twinkling .
n02-157-05.jpg	3" He powerful anxious , poor Mistah Piers .
n02-157-06.jpg	We all know how Balicou Island dangerous
n02-157-07.jpg	to all kin' o' boats , wid d'ose big , big
n02-157-08.jpg	rocks in an' out o' de water .
n03-038-00.jpg	He had almost entirely settled back into his old
n03-038-01.jpg	ways , even to reading law about two hours each
n03-038-02.jpg	day . Though he did not refuse wine , which the
n03-038-03.jpg	judge always had on the table at dinner , he
n03-038-04.jpg	did not act as though he found it necessary
n03-038-05.jpg	except in moderate compliance with his father's
n03-038-06.jpg	habit .
n03-064-00.jpg	Around that rounded rocky promontory where the
n03-064-01.jpg	white spray could be seen flying across the distance
n03-064-02.jpg	of a mile and a half , came the yawl under her full
n03-064-03.jpg	triangular sail , and to the judge's frightened eyes , so
n03-064-04.jpg	close to the rocks that it would be dashed
n03-064-05.jpg	against them with the lift of the next wave .
n03-066-00.jpg	" That boy ! That damned fool boy ! What does he mean
n03-066-01.jpg	by trying to come home now , even if he did promise ?
n03-066-02.jpg	What does time mean when weighed against the life of
n03-066-03.jpg	two human beings ? " Not until he was certain that the
n03-066-04.jpg	yawl had rounded the rocky point instead of
n03-066-05.jpg	being flung against the huge boulders did the judge
n03-066-06.jpg	empty his lungs of stifling air and refill them
n03-066-07.jpg	with part of that howling northwest gale .
n03-097-00.jpg	" My God ! " the judge cried out . " The boy
n03-097-01.jpg	is going to try to make a landing on the
n03-097-02.jpg	weather side of that pier ! He'll wreck ! "
n03-097-03.jpg	Willie Kim was speechless , only his slant
n03-097-04.jpg	black eyes showing any emotion . With a
n03-097-05.jpg	quick shift of tiller , and at the same time
n03-097-06.jpg	jibbing the boom to which he had the
n03-097-07.jpg	stay rope fastened , Bill made the
n03-097-08.jpg	yawl recover .
n03-103-00.jpg	It seemed to the frightened judge
n03-103-01.jpg	as though his son would actually
n03-103-02.jpg	shoot the craft in under the outer
n03-103-03.jpg	end of the wharf . But by pressing
n03-103-04.jpg	the tiller hard over and at the
n03-103-05.jpg	same time dropping the small sheet
n03-103-06.jpg	of wet canvas , Bill cleared the
n03-103-07.jpg	corner of the pier by inches , and
n03-103-08.jpg	with the tiller still hard over , brought
n03-103-09.jpg	the yawl up against the waves
n03-106-00.jpg	" Willie , " the judge said huskily ,
n03-106-01.jpg	" that was as pretty a piece of seamans-
n03-106-02.jpg	hip as I ever saw . That boy of
n03-106-03.jpg	mine seems to know how to do
n03-106-04.jpg	everything , when he wants to . "
n03-106-05.jpg	" 3Naw , " disputed Willie . 3" Just
n03-106-06.jpg	play in damn fine luck this time .
n03-106-07.jpg	He plenty smart though . " As they
n03-106-08.jpg	reached the pier , the judge on legs
n03-106-09.jpg	that were a little unsteady , they
n03-106-10.jpg	found Bueno Buck , now on the
n03-106-11.jpg	pier , leading the yawl toward
n03-113-00.jpg	" Hello , Dad ! " Bill called . " I hope you
n03-113-01.jpg	weren't worried . We're going to
n03-113-02.jpg	drag the boat ashore and turn
n03-113-03.jpg	her over . She has a foot of
n03-113-04.jpg	water in her . I wouldn't be
n03-113-05.jpg	surprised if we broke all
n03-113-06.jpg	speed records on the way in .
n03-113-07.jpg	Yes sir , I am slightly wet , and
n03-113-08.jpg	Buck would be wetter if he
n03-113-09.jpg	had more clothes on . "
n03-120-00.jpg	With four doing the job and the waves
n03-120-01.jpg	pushing at the stern , the yawl was soon
n03-120-02.jpg	dragged out but before it was turned
n03-120-03.jpg	over Bueno Buck reached into the foot
n03-120-04.jpg	of water , tossed out a string of silvery
n03-120-05.jpg	lake trout and said - 3" Bill , he's better
n03-120-06.jpg	man at catch 'em than Injun , Judge .
n03-120-07.jpg	You look . Little one more as fifteen
n03-120-08.jpg	inches . Maybe big one four feet ,
n03-120-09.jpg	huh ? "
n03-126-00.jpg	" By George , that is a beautiful string of fish ! "
n03-126-01.jpg	exclaimed the judge . " Toss them on the grass
n03-126-02.jpg	and then we'll all get hold and heave . " A
n03-126-03.jpg	few moments later the yawl was upside
n03-126-04.jpg	down , exposing its shallow keel .
n04-000-00.jpg	Bertram's face was grim . " You think it was the Snort ,
n04-000-01.jpg	don't you ? " John gave a short laugh . " I did , " he
n04-000-02.jpg	said ; " but I'd better stop thinking that now .
n04-000-03.jpg	Pericles is fitted with an identically similar one . "
n04-000-04.jpg	" So there you are , my dear . " Peggy's eyes filled
n04-000-05.jpg	with tears . " It's so unfair , " she said .
n04-009-00.jpg	" That little beast Robbie Munyard spent six
n04-009-01.jpg	months ashore while Pericles was refitting in the
n04-009-02.jpg	dockyard and now that she's ready for sea he goes
n04-009-03.jpg	sick . Just because he's an Honourable he can do
n04-009-04.jpg	what he likes . Anyway , why pick on you to succeed
n04-009-05.jpg	him ? " John didn't answer . There was no point
n04-009-06.jpg	in sharing his discomfort with Peggy .
n04-048-00.jpg	So he put up for the night at The Admiral's Head , that
n04-048-01.jpg	famous Portsmouth hostelry , second only in historic
n04-048-02.jpg	interest to The George , unhappily destroyed by German
n04-048-03.jpg	bombs during the last war . Having deposited his
n04-048-04.jpg	baggage and unpacked his overnight-bag he
n04-048-05.jpg	went in search of a drink . The lower bar was
n04-048-06.jpg	empty , save for the lady known by all habitue
n04-048-07.jpg	*?2s as ' Seaweed ' , and a youngish , sharp-eyed
n04-048-08.jpg	man who was staring moodily into a gin
n04-048-09.jpg	and tonic .
n04-052-00.jpg	Seaweed's memory was prodigious ; her manner
n04-052-01.jpg	must have been worth a great deal to the proprietors
n04-052-02.jpg	of the hotel . She greeted John , however , with less
n04-052-03.jpg	than her usual cordiality and flashed a warning
n04-052-04.jpg	glance at him . Evidently the other occupant
n04-052-05.jpg	of the bar was not 6persona grata . If her
n04-052-06.jpg	memory was good , so was this stranger's .
n04-052-07.jpg	" You're Commander Winter , " he said . " Have a
n04-052-08.jpg	gin ? " He turned to Seaweed -
n04-060-00.jpg	" Make it a large one , darling . I know the naval
n04-060-01.jpg	habits . ' Drink gin and call each other wallahs ,
n04-060-02.jpg	what ! ' - as the Guards officer said on his return
n04-060-03.jpg	from a visit to the Royal Navy . Submarines , what .
n04-060-04.jpg	Youngest D.S.C. in the war , what ? Crawled
n04-060-05.jpg	inside a submarine casing to defuse a Jerry
n04-060-06.jpg	bomb . Should have been a V.C.
n04-068-00.jpg	What are you waiting for , darling ? The officer is
n04-068-01.jpg	obviously thirsty . " John fought back his
n04-068-02.jpg	inherited desire to snub the man . If he did he
n04-068-03.jpg	would have to leave the bar and either sit in
n04-068-04.jpg	the lounge or return to his bedroom .
n04-068-05.jpg	Seaweed sensed his embarrassment and
n04-068-06.jpg	came to the rescue . " You haven't introduced
n04-068-07.jpg	yourself , " she said with mock severity .
n04-075-00.jpg	" It's a rule on these premises . No treating with
n04-075-01.jpg	strangers - that's right , John , isn't it ? " " My
n04-075-02.jpg	fault entirely , " said the stranger . " It's my conceited
n04-075-03.jpg	nature - I assumed that you both knew who I
n04-075-04.jpg	was . I'm Ian Bawley . Does that mean anything
n04-075-05.jpg	to you ? " It did . Ian Bawley's name was
n04-075-06.jpg	printed at the head of most naval articles
n04-075-07.jpg	in the Daily Courier .
n04-084-00.jpg	" Oh , the Press , " said Seaweed . " Down here on business , Mr.
n04-084-01.jpg	Bawley ? " " A pressman is always on the job . "
n04-084-02.jpg	He held out his hand and John could not do
n04-084-03.jpg	otherwise than take it . " Pleased to meet you ,
n04-084-04.jpg	Commander , " he said . " Now what about that
n04-084-05.jpg	drink ? " John nodded - he could afford to buy
n04-084-06.jpg	one in return and he was lonely .
n04-092-00.jpg	" For the sake of accuracy , " he said , " and I
n04-092-01.jpg	know how you newspaper people value that commodity ! -
n04-092-02.jpg	please don't address me as Commander . I'm
n04-092-03.jpg	a Lieutenant-Commander . Perhaps we could
n04-092-04.jpg	drop the rank - such a mouthful ! " " You're
n04-092-05.jpg	absolutely right , " said Bawley , as he pushed over
n04-092-06.jpg	his glass . " Fill it up , darling . Accuracy above
n04-092-07.jpg	all else . We pride ourselves about accuracy on
n04-092-08.jpg	the Courier .
n04-100-00.jpg	Ever known us bowl a wide about your Service ?
n04-100-01.jpg	Check and counter-check - nothing but the truth .
n04-100-02.jpg	Somewhat embarrassing , what ? " " How can the
n04-100-03.jpg	truth be embarrassing ? " John sipped his double
n04-100-04.jpg	gin with relish . It was his favourite brand ,
n04-100-05.jpg	he was on the verge of a new chapter in
n04-100-06.jpg	his career , and his companion's attitude was
n04-100-07.jpg	challenging .
n04-107-00.jpg	Life at home and in Bath had been a
n04-107-01.jpg	trifle too comfortable and humdrum .
n04-107-02.jpg	He'd never before met a pressman and
n04-107-03.jpg	found him curiously stimulating . " You're a
n04-107-04.jpg	bit of a humorist , aren't you ? " said
n04-107-05.jpg	Bawley . " The truth is usually very embarra-
n04-107-06.jpg	ssing . You're in submarines , aren't you ? "
n04-107-07.jpg	" You know a great deal about me , "
n04-107-08.jpg	said John .
n04-114-00.jpg	" It's my business . I'll tell you more . You're
n04-114-01.jpg	going to take over command of Pericles . Am I
n04-114-02.jpg	right ? " " Who told you ? " " Little bird .
n04-114-03.jpg	Other half ? " John nodded . " On me . " Bawley
n04-114-04.jpg	shook his head . " All paid for by His Lordship , "
n04-114-05.jpg	he said . " Expense account . You're a married
n04-114-06.jpg	man with a couple of kids . Can't go wasting
n04-114-07.jpg	your substance on a complete stranger . Set
n04-114-08.jpg	'em up , darling ! "
n04-130-00.jpg	John flushed . " I'm not in need of charity . " " Come
n04-130-01.jpg	off it , " said Bawley . " The proprietor of the Daily
n04-130-02.jpg	Courier knows what's going on . If he doesn't mind ,
n04-130-03.jpg	why should you ? " " I see . " John took the
n04-130-04.jpg	refilled glass and looked over the rim at his
n04-130-05.jpg	companion . " You want me to talk , is that it ? "
n04-139-00.jpg	" You misjudge me , " said Bawley . " You have
n04-139-01.jpg	nothing to tell me , yet . But we'll be meeting
n04-139-02.jpg	again , no doubt , and then you will have .
n04-139-03.jpg	Regard this as a softening-up process , and
n04-139-04.jpg	have dinner with me ? On His Lordship ,
n04-139-05.jpg	of course . " " On one condition , " said John .
n04-139-06.jpg	" Tell me who the little bird was . " " Can't
n04-139-07.jpg	you guess ? Whose portrait appears regularly
n04-139-08.jpg	in the shiny papers ? "
n04-149-00.jpg	" You mean Munyard ? " " Sure . Very useful
n04-149-01.jpg	contact , is our Robbie ; he gives us the gen and
n04-149-02.jpg	we give him the publicity . ' The Honourable
n04-149-03.jpg	" Robbie " and friend ' , what ? You know the
n04-149-04.jpg	sort of thing . " " You'll get nothing out of me , "
n04-149-05.jpg	said John , " but you can pay for my drinks
n04-149-06.jpg	if you want to , as long as you keep off
n04-149-07.jpg	Service matters . "
n04-156-00.jpg	" Good-oh ! One for the grill-room , darling , and
n04-156-01.jpg	tell George to bring in the 6carte du jour . "
n04-156-02.jpg	Bawley was a man of his word . He kept
n04-156-03.jpg	away from Service matters , was an excellent
n04-156-04.jpg	host and a splendid raconteur . The evening
n04-156-05.jpg	passed all too quickly . As they parted in
n04-156-06.jpg	the vestibule the two men were well
n04-156-07.jpg	disposed towards each other .
n04-163-00.jpg	" Ever been to Fleet Street ? " asked Bawley .
n04-163-01.jpg	" You should . Next time you're in Town
n04-163-02.jpg	give me a ring at this number and I'll
n04-163-03.jpg	take you round the pubs where most
n04-163-04.jpg	of the work is done . " He held out a card .
n04-163-05.jpg	John took it and put it in his pocket .
n04-163-06.jpg	" Thanks , " he said . " If ever my missus
n04-163-07.jpg	lets me off the chain I'll take you
n04-163-08.jpg	up on that .
n04-202-00.jpg	Glad I met you . Don't forget to give me a ring -
n04-202-01.jpg	any time - knock twice and ask for Bawley , what ? "
n04-202-02.jpg	" I don't know when that will be , " said John .
n04-202-03.jpg	" I shall be busy for a while , cleaning up after
n04-202-04.jpg	Master bloody Munyard . " THERE were six submarines ,
n04-202-05.jpg	lying in pairs alongside the jetty at Fort Blockhouse .
n04-202-06.jpg	Black and grimly businesslike they both looked and
n04-202-07.jpg	sounded , for all of them were rumbling as they
n04-202-08.jpg	charged their electric batteries .
n04-209-00.jpg	A light wind wafted the smoke of diesel exhaust in
n04-209-01.jpg	through the open windows of the Captain's house . It
n04-209-02.jpg	pervaded every room but neither Harry nor Madeleine
n04-209-03.jpg	Turton noticed its existence as they sat in silence over
n04-209-04.jpg	a substantial breakfast . Although usually a very
n04-209-05.jpg	talkative lady Madeleine respected her husband's
n04-209-06.jpg	silences , for she knew they betokened a worry of
n04-209-07.jpg	some sort .
n04-213-00.jpg	There had been many such breakfasts lately since the
n04-213-01.jpg	affair of Parsifal . Harry had lost a good deal of weight .
n04-213-02.jpg	His normal placid and steady-going manner remained ,
n04-213-03.jpg	but she could see that it no longer came naturally .
n04-213-04.jpg	It is the common lot of all Squadron Senior Officers
n04-213-05.jpg	to experience such catastrophes as the loss of a submarine ,
n04-213-06.jpg	though in peace time these happenings are few and
n04-213-07.jpg	far between .
n04-218-00.jpg	This is the testing time for all . The affair blows up into
n04-218-01.jpg	a national disaster and then when it is all over life
n04-218-02.jpg	must continue as before . During this period the Captain
n04-218-03.jpg	must present an unruffled appearance and carry on as
n04-218-04.jpg	if nothing unusual has happened . Harry Turton had
n04-218-05.jpg	written letters to the bereaved , had visited many in the
n04-218-06.jpg	locality , had been interviewed by the Press , had driven
n04-218-07.jpg	his surviving submarines a good deal harder than
n04-218-08.jpg	usual and in fact had applied all the usual specifics
n04-218-09.jpg	suitable for such occasions .
n06-074-00.jpg	He rode down to where I was waiting . I was
n06-074-01.jpg	thinking what a skill he had for reading
n06-074-02.jpg	my mind . " This would be as good a place
n06-074-03.jpg	for a hold-up as any , " he said , reining in
n06-074-04.jpg	near me . " Yes , " I said . " It'll be here to-
n06-074-05.jpg	morrow as likely as not . " I paused . " Miss
n06-074-06.jpg	Jeannie'll be on that coach , Dan . "
n06-082-00.jpg	" Yes , " he said . " I know . " " No harm must come
n06-082-01.jpg	to her , Dan . " " She'll be all right . It's the
n06-082-02.jpg	men who'll be after that coach I'm interested
n06-082-03.jpg	in , Johnny . " " I know . But if lead starts
n06-082-04.jpg	flying she might be in danger . " " That's so .
n06-082-05.jpg	But I reckon they'll be too busy shooting at
n06-082-06.jpg	us to bother with the coach and the folks
n06-082-07.jpg	in it . "
n06-092-00.jpg	" Maybe , " I said . " But we've got to remember
n06-092-01.jpg	that girl all the time , Dan . I feel kind
n06-092-02.jpg	of responsible for her . " " Of course , " he said ,
n06-092-03.jpg	giving me one of his strange looks . Then he
n06-092-04.jpg	turned the conversation . " Let's ride over
n06-092-05.jpg	and have a look at the mining camp .
n06-092-06.jpg	After all it's them we're supposed to be
n06-092-07.jpg	working for , as well as the townsfolk and
n06-092-08.jpg	the agency detective . "
n06-100-00.jpg	With something of a start I remembered the
n06-100-01.jpg	man who'd brought us into this business .
n06-100-02.jpg	" Maybe you don't know about Appleton ,
n06-100-03.jpg	Dan ? " " Know what ? " " That he's dead , "
n06-100-04.jpg	I said . I watched him because I was always
n06-100-05.jpg	fascinated by the way he looked when you
n06-100-06.jpg	tried to surprise him . " Dead ? " he said . " Yes .
n06-100-07.jpg	Dead . Shuffled out of the deck . Blasted
n06-100-08.jpg	down with a shotgun outside the Palace
n06-100-09.jpg	last night . "
n06-111-00.jpg	" Fenton or Somers , " he said . " Or the Town
n06-111-01.jpg	Marshal , " I added . His face was fixed ,
n06-111-02.jpg	unreadable as a rock . " Let's get over to the
n06-111-03.jpg	mining camp , " he said abruptly . He wheeled
n06-111-04.jpg	his horse back off the trail and up the slope
n06-111-05.jpg	leading to the ridge . I followed . From the
n06-111-06.jpg	top you could see something of the wild hill
n06-111-07.jpg	country that lay all round Gilburg Crossing .
n06-119-00.jpg	The air was fresh and clear and you
n06-119-01.jpg	could see far over west and north for many
n06-119-02.jpg	miles . The real high country of the Rockies
n06-119-03.jpg	lifted up in the distance like a pale water-
n06-119-04.jpg	colour drawing . Between us and that lay
n06-119-05.jpg	a vast stretch of hills , canyons , buttes and
n06-119-06.jpg	malpais .
n06-123-00.jpg	" The mine-workings lie north of the town , "
n06-123-01.jpg	said Dan . " If we head west we ought to
n06-123-02.jpg	cut the trail leading from Gilburg to the north . "
n06-123-03.jpg	So we swung west , making slow going over
n06-123-04.jpg	rough country , sliding on shale , climbing down
n06-123-05.jpg	into draws , circling a big mesa by a
n06-123-06.jpg	four or five mile valley , sandy-floored . It
n06-123-07.jpg	got hotter as the day wore on and we rested
n06-123-08.jpg	gratefully by a small creek where we watered
n06-123-09.jpg	the horses and drank enough to cure our
n06-123-10.jpg	thirst .
n06-128-00.jpg	An hour's riding brought us to a trail that
n06-128-01.jpg	we figured would lead to the miners' camp .
n06-128-02.jpg	We turned north into it and after about four
n06-128-03.jpg	miles it led into a small canyon which
n06-128-04.jpg	opened out into a wide shallow draw .
n06-128-05.jpg	Here in a dried-up creek-bed we found
n06-128-06.jpg	the miners at work . They were scattered
n06-128-07.jpg	over a fairly wide area working singly or
n06-128-08.jpg	in pairs .
n06-133-00.jpg	We didn't approach unchallenged . Just short
n06-133-01.jpg	of the diggings there was a roughly-built
n06-133-02.jpg	shack and as we got near someone inside bawled
n06-133-03.jpg	out , " If you come any closer , I'll sure blow
n06-133-04.jpg	your whiskers off . " " Take it easy , mister , " I sang
n06-133-05.jpg	out . " We don't aim to come any closer and we've
n06-133-06.jpg	got no whiskers so as you can see . Just you
n06-133-07.jpg	go and tell Nick Dowd we've come to talk
n06-133-08.jpg	to him about what happened last night . "
n06-140-00.jpg	" Oh , " said the unseen guard . He blew a
n06-140-01.jpg	whistle then , loud and shrill . The gun barrel
n06-140-02.jpg	peeking out through a hole in the shack never
n06-140-03.jpg	wavered . We sat our horses , waiting . " Looks as
n06-140-04.jpg	though they're expecting trouble , " I said . " Where
n06-140-05.jpg	there's gold and women there's always trouble , "
n06-140-06.jpg	observed Dan , shifting about in his saddle . He
n06-140-07.jpg	was never long on patience .
p01-147-00.jpg	Mr. Copthorne knew a way round by the side
p01-147-01.jpg	of the church where there was a small open
p01-147-02.jpg	outbuilding where the grave digger kept his spades
p01-147-03.jpg	and forks and tidying up implements . It might
p01-147-04.jpg	be open . It was . He entered , and seated himself
p01-147-05.jpg	in a huddle upon an upturned wheelbarrow .
p01-147-06.jpg	His curious headgear fell off . Strange things
p01-147-07.jpg	were going on in his bewildered brain . When
p01-147-08.jpg	a man was drowning and towards his last
p01-147-09.jpg	gasp it was scientifically supposed his whole
p01-147-10.jpg	life came up before him in some cinematic
p01-147-11.jpg	kind of sequence .
p01-155-00.jpg	Mr. Copthorne was on dry land in a church
p01-155-01.jpg	outbuilding , but this was happening to him now . He
p01-155-02.jpg	saw himself as a sulky , ugly , malformed , repressed
p01-155-03.jpg	boy , then a young youth . He saw himself refusing
p01-155-04.jpg	baptism according to the sect his parents belonged to .
p01-155-05.jpg	Walking out of the chapel later on . Continuing
p01-155-06.jpg	on , his leaping mind flashed pictures of chi-
p01-155-07.jpg	canery and corruption , the growth of the dea-
p01-155-08.jpg	dly decadence and absorption in debase-
p01-155-09.jpg	ment and Satanic debauchery .
p01-168-00.jpg	He didn't know what to make of it , but it
p01-168-01.jpg	was Mr. Copthorne all right . Perhaps he had
p01-168-02.jpg	been attending some kind of fancy dress do
p01-168-03.jpg	in London . Very strange his eyes looked . Mad ,
p01-168-04.jpg	hunted eyes , as if the poor fellow had rocks in
p01-168-05.jpg	his head , so the verger described afterwards .
p01-168-06.jpg	" You're very early about , sir , " he said , trying to
p01-168-07.jpg	speak normally .
p01-174-00.jpg	" Yes . I travelled down from London
p01-174-01.jpg	as the dawn was breaking , and
p01-174-02.jpg	the thought came to me I'd like
p01-174-03.jpg	to take a look at the church . I've
p01-174-04.jpg	never been inside . Very remiss of
p01-174-05.jpg	me , " said Mr. Copthorne . The verger
p01-174-06.jpg	led the way in . " The stained glass
p01-174-07.jpg	windows , sir , they date back to
p01-174-08.jpg	the fourteenth century . "
p02-000-00.jpg	There were few passengers on the plane and Gavin was
p02-000-01.jpg	quickly through the customs . " Gay ! " " Gavin ! " The girl
p02-000-02.jpg	and her luggage had disappeared and they were alone
p02-000-03.jpg	together . The porter brought Gavin's bag out to the
p02-000-04.jpg	taxi . " Just a moment , darling , " Gavin pressed her
p02-000-05.jpg	hand and smiled . " I want to check up on the
p02-000-06.jpg	flights back . "
p02-008-00.jpg	Gay went out to the waiting
p02-008-01.jpg	taxi , and then found that in
p02-008-02.jpg	the excitement of meeting
p02-008-03.jpg	Gavin she had left her sun-
p02-008-04.jpg	glasses on the veranda . She
p02-008-05.jpg	went quickly back to fetch them .
p02-008-06.jpg	Gavin and the girl who had got
p02-008-07.jpg	off the plane with him were talking .
p02-008-08.jpg	He was writing something in his
p02-008-09.jpg	pocket-book , with a sick feeling
p02-008-10.jpg	of despair Gay knew that of course
p02-022-00.jpg	" And then we'll go for a stroll along the
p02-022-01.jpg	beach . A moon like this mustn't be wasted . "
p02-022-02.jpg	He gestured towards the bay where the full
p02-022-03.jpg	moon was just rising over the rocks , then
p02-022-04.jpg	laid his hand on hers . Gay smiled at him
p02-022-05.jpg	again , happy beyond belief , knowing that
p02-022-06.jpg	now Gavin was in love with her and her
p02-022-07.jpg	only , yet remembering for a second the
p02-022-08.jpg	kisses she had seen him giving Elaine .
p02-027-00.jpg	All that was part of the past , she would put it behind her . She
p02-027-01.jpg	would never be jealous again , would even take Larry's advice and
p02-027-02.jpg	look the other way if need be . " I say ! " Gavin was looking over her
p02-027-03.jpg	shoulder . " That's a pretty girl ! " Gay glanced behind her , " Isn't she
p02-027-04.jpg	lovely , she's French , a very well known model I believe .
p02-069-00.jpg	Gay , a little puzzled , went through
p02-069-01.jpg	to the bar . Doc and Lilyan were
p02-069-02.jpg	sitting just inside having coffee .
p02-069-03.jpg	" Come and join us and bring your
p02-069-04.jpg	boy friend , " Doc called . " No , Doc ! "
p02-069-05.jpg	Lilyan remonstrated . " They want to be
p02-069-06.jpg	alone . " " I've booked a table at the
p02-069-07.jpg	cafe*?2 , " Doc said , " they are packed
p02-069-08.jpg	tonight so come and join us if you
p02-069-09.jpg	can't find a table for two . "
p02-076-00.jpg	Gay thanked him and walked out on to
p02-076-01.jpg	the terrace thinking that perhaps Gavin
p02-076-02.jpg	had bought a drink and taken it outside .
p02-076-03.jpg	She looked round scanning the tables ,
p02-076-04.jpg	then caught her breath , a cold hand
p02-076-05.jpg	seeming to clutch her heart . Gavin was
p02-076-06.jpg	seated at a small table in a shadowy
p02-076-07.jpg	corner talking animatedly to Simone .
p02-076-08.jpg	As Gay watched he offered the girl a
p02-076-09.jpg	cigarette and lit it , his hands cupping
p02-076-10.jpg	hers in an intimate way .
p02-081-00.jpg	Gay stood irresolute for a moment , half
p02-081-01.jpg	decided to go back and join Lilyan and
p02-081-02.jpg	Doc , while she wanted to do no more than
p02-081-03.jpg	run upstairs to her room , knowing that
p02-081-04.jpg	Gavin although he had told her that he
p02-081-05.jpg	loved her , was already flirting with a girl
p02-081-06.jpg	that he had only met a few minutes before .
p02-081-07.jpg	Larry's advice flashed through her mind ,
p02-081-08.jpg	but she turned away , giving a little
p02-081-09.jpg	gesture of hopelessness , knowing that her
p02-090-00.jpg	The others were all dancing and
p02-090-01.jpg	as Gay drew out a chair and sat
p02-090-02.jpg	down Gavin , without a word , swept
p02-090-03.jpg	Simone on to the floor . " It doesn't mean
p02-090-04.jpg	anything , " Gay told herself desperately ,
p02-090-05.jpg	trying to understand Gavin's point of
p02-090-06.jpg	view and remembering the advice
p02-090-07.jpg	that Larry had given her , while she
p02-090-08.jpg	felt wretched beyond words .
p02-101-00.jpg	His behaviour was not only boorish and in the worst of
p02-101-01.jpg	taste but it was unkind beyond words . She fumbled
p02-101-02.jpg	with the cigarette packet which lay on the table
p02-101-03.jpg	not wanting to smoke but needing some action
p02-101-04.jpg	to help her control her feelings . " Come and
p02-101-05.jpg	dance , " Doc's cheery voice came as a
p02-101-06.jpg	lifeline and Gay got up quickly , mana-
p02-101-07.jpg	ging a smile .
p02-105-00.jpg	As he swung her on to the floor Gay saw Gavin
p02-105-01.jpg	and Simone go through the doorway that led
p02-105-02.jpg	down to the beach . Gay closed her eyes for a
p02-105-03.jpg	moment in disgust . She was fully aware that Gavin
p02-105-04.jpg	would make love to the French girl on the sands ,
p02-105-05.jpg	and no doubt he would come back soon and
p02-105-06.jpg	after Simone had left expect her to accept his
p02-105-07.jpg	kisses on the way back to the hotel .

p02-109-02.jpg	" And that's the man whom you have been eating your
p02-109-03.jpg	heart out over ? " Doc nodded towards the door . " You
p02-109-04.jpg	may consider him a man , I would say he was a
p02-109-05.jpg	mentally adolescent cad . " " Oh , Doc ... " Gay protested
p02-109-06.jpg	weakly , " you don't know Gavin . " " I've only met him
p02-109-07.jpg	today but I think I can safely say that I know
p02-109-08.jpg	him a great deal better than you do . "
p02-115-00.jpg	Doc gave her hand a shake . " Wake up
p02-115-01.jpg	Gay , and don't even contemplate throwing
p02-115-02.jpg	yourself away on a chap like that . You're a
p02-115-03.jpg	fine girl , intelligent , and pretty , and I had
p02-115-04.jpg	thought you were sensible too . Don't

p02-135-00.jpg	Doc asked Lilyan to dance and once
p02-135-01.jpg	again Gay found herself alone at the table
p02-135-02.jpg	feeling self-conscious and awkward , sure that
p02-135-03.jpg	people were talking about the way Gavin
p02-135-04.jpg	was behaving since they had seen them
p02-135-05.jpg	dining together . She opened her bag
p02-135-06.jpg	to get out her compact and saw Grace's
p02-135-07.jpg	letter . She drew it out and opened it ,
p02-135-08.jpg	glad to be able to occupy herself .
p02-139-00.jpg	" So glad that you are having such a lovely time , dearie , "
p02-139-01.jpg	it ran . " Your cards are lovely . I rang up Miss Harland
p02-139-02.jpg	and have been over to sit with her father and do what
p02-139-03.jpg	I can for him so that she can get out to do her shopping .
p02-139-04.jpg	He's getting on well but is pretty helpless still with his
p02-139-05.jpg	broken arm .
p02-144-00.jpg	No other news except that Elaine is engaged
p02-144-01.jpg	and going to marry a foreigner ... "
p02-144-02.jpg	Gay read the rest of the letter then put
p02-144-03.jpg	it back in her bag . Elaine was engaged ,
p02-144-04.jpg	to the man she had spent so much time
p02-144-05.jpg	with at her party . That was why
p02-144-06.jpg	Gavin had come back to her .
p02-144-07.jpg	Everything was quite clear now , and to
p02-144-08.jpg	her own surprise Gay felt no heartbreak ,
p02-144-09.jpg	rather a sense of relief now that she
p02-144-10.jpg	knew why Gavin had come to see
p02-144-11.jpg	her .
p02-150-00.jpg	Because she was second best . The others came back
p02-150-01.jpg	to the table , all of them making a fuss of her and at once
p02-150-02.jpg	she felt happier . Gay loved them for their warm sympathy ,
p02-150-03.jpg	knowing that they were real friends , even if they were new ones .
p02-150-04.jpg	" That is a pretty dress , " Lilyan commented , obviously sensing
p02-150-05.jpg	Gay's distress and in a way that Doc , as a man , could not
p02-150-06.jpg	understand , knowing that Gay was as much ashamed
p02-150-07.jpg	for Gavin at the way he was behaving as she
p02-150-08.jpg	was hurt for herself .
p03-012-00.jpg	" There are all sorts of wonder-
p03-012-01.jpg	ful jobs in London and I could
p03-012-02.jpg	take my pick , whereas in Yarmouth
p03-012-03.jpg	one has to know something about fishing
p03-012-04.jpg	and in Liverpool they'd want sea-farers .
p03-012-05.jpg	I don't think I'd go to Edinburgh un-
p03-012-06.jpg	less I was a Scot and wanting to get
p03-012-07.jpg	home , or perhaps a student studying to
p03-012-08.jpg	be a doctor , and I already know
p03-012-09.jpg	all about that . "
p03-023-00.jpg	She was engaged to Nigel , had been for two years .
p03-023-01.jpg	Sometimes they talked on the theme of " when we get married " ,
p03-023-02.jpg	and then all was wonderful , and perhaps it had only been
p03-023-03.jpg	a slip of the tongue when Nigel had said , only last
p03-023-04.jpg	evening , " If we get married , old girl , you'll have to stop
p03-023-05.jpg	that lark , I can tell you ! "
p03-027-00.jpg	She couldn't remember what they had been talking about or
p03-027-01.jpg	which ' lark ' she would have to stop , only that significant tiny
p03-027-02.jpg	word shouted into her very soul a horn of warning , and
p03-027-03.jpg	with it was coupled a disembodied fragment of information ,
p03-027-04.jpg	which now took on an ominous significance : Nigel had been
p03-027-05.jpg	seen in Farlingham on an occasion he had sworn he had
p03-027-06.jpg	been standing in for Luke Parsons at his surgery in
p03-027-07.jpg	Little Phelpham .
p03-029-00.jpg	Now Nigel had every right to go where he
p03-029-01.jpg	liked during his off-duty periods
p03-029-02.jpg	when she was not free ; this much they had
p03-029-03.jpg	conceded one to the other . They rarely
p03-029-04.jpg	found they were off duty together , and
p03-029-05.jpg	the situation would have been intolerable
p03-029-06.jpg	had there not been some give and take
p03-029-07.jpg	about their relationship . So when Nigel
p03-029-08.jpg	had told her about taking Luke's
p03-029-09.jpg	evening surgery she had said ,
p03-033-00.jpg	" Bless you ! I hope Luke is suitably grateful , darling . " " Oh , well , "
p03-033-01.jpg	he shrugged diffidently , " I like the work . One gets plenty
p03-033-02.jpg	of variety and it's a change . " Nigel was the hospital's
p03-033-03.jpg	Junior Medical Officer . " You won't be free about nine , I
p03-033-04.jpg	suppose , to meet me for supper somewhere ? " she had
p03-033-05.jpg	asked hopefully .
p03-040-00.jpg	" Hardly likely , my sweet . Luke's surgery goes on for
p03-040-01.jpg	hours . If they get in before eight-thirty , even
p03-040-02.jpg	though they're standing on one another's toes ,
p03-040-03.jpg	I've got to see 'em . If I am free , though ,
p03-040-04.jpg	I'll give you a ring , O.K. ? " O.K. , " she had
p03-040-05.jpg	replied readily . So how could Nigel have
p03-040-06.jpg	been at the Load of Trouble roadhouse ,
p03-040-07.jpg	dancing with a blonde at eight-thirty that
p03-040-08.jpg	very evening ?
p03-047-00.jpg	" No , " she told Phil Gubbins , a junior
p03-047-01.jpg	houseman , " it wasn't Nigel you saw ,
p03-047-02.jpg	my lad . " " It was Nigel's car , anyway .
p03-047-03.jpg	NUF 121 . " " He probably loaned his car
p03-047-04.jpg	to somebody , Phil . He's always doing that . "
p03-047-05.jpg	Young Gubbins shrugged . " I didn't see his
p03-047-06.jpg	face , Di , but it certainly looked like
p03-047-07.jpg	Nigel from the back . D.j. and all .
p03-047-08.jpg	Of course such as I couldn't afford
p03-047-09.jpg	to go into the Load of Trouble . "
p03-072-00.jpg	" 5Ye-es ? " he lowered his eyes and kissed her on the
p03-072-01.jpg	mouth , an act of devotion he didn't over-indulge .
p03-072-02.jpg	" What about it , my sweet ? " " Well , " she laughed
p03-072-03.jpg	suddenly in an upsurging of relief , " that stupid
p03-072-04.jpg	Gubbins boy thought he saw you at the Load of Trouble .
p03-072-05.jpg	With a blonde , too . Imagine ! " Nigel was frowning . He
p03-072-06.jpg	looked distinguished when he frowned ; boyishly
p03-072-07.jpg	handsome at other times .
p03-080-00.jpg	" Gubbins ? Gubbins ? " he fretted . " Who's he ? "
p03-080-01.jpg	Though Diana knew the name of every
p03-080-02.jpg	member of the staff , distinguished or not ,
p03-080-03.jpg	Nigel often had to think hard to sort
p03-080-04.jpg	them out . " He's the carrotty lad , isn't he ? "
p03-080-05.jpg	he now demanded . " What was he
p03-080-06.jpg	doing at the Load of Trouble ? "
p03-163-00.jpg	" But I want it ! " she protested . " It's my ring . "
p03-163-01.jpg	" You just gave it back to me . " " I
p03-163-02.jpg	didn't ! I was joking . You know I was
p03-163-03.jpg	joking , Nigel . " " You shouldn't joke
p03-163-04.jpg	about serious things like engagements . "
p03-163-05.jpg	" Don't be such a baby ! " They were going
p03-163-06.jpg	to have an open quarrel
p03-163-07.jpg	any minute , and she knew it .
p03-173-00.jpg	Almost in desperation she appealed , " Will you meet
p03-173-01.jpg	me at the gate , four o'clock tomorrow ? " " Why ? " he
p03-173-02.jpg	enquired , combing his thick , tawny hair . " To bring
p03-173-03.jpg	me up for tea , of course . I just thought . " " I'll see , "
p03-173-04.jpg	he told her , and suddenly seized her in an embrace
p03-173-05.jpg	which really hurt . " Without your ring it's just like
p03-173-06.jpg	kissing somebody else's girl , " he decided wickedly ,
p03-173-07.jpg	and kissed her again , somewhat startled to
p03-173-08.jpg	receive a sharp slap for his pains .
p03-181-00.jpg	" If I were somebody else's girl that's
p03-181-01.jpg	what you'd get , " she flashed at him , and
p03-181-02.jpg	so had left him , on her dignity and not
p03-181-03.jpg	seeing the look of admiration and revelation
p03-181-04.jpg	which had followed her slim young figure
p03-181-05.jpg	out of his sight . " Mine , " Nigel Lester had
p03-181-06.jpg	decided with a sigh of satisfaction , and
p03-181-07.jpg	then regarded the ring which he retrieved
p03-181-08.jpg	from his pocket . " At a price , " he concluded ,
p03-181-09.jpg	with some bitterness .
p03-189-00.jpg	Sentence Database P03-189
p03-189-01.jpg	They often had such a rendezvous , for
p03-189-02.jpg	there was just time to smoke a cigarette ,
p03-189-03.jpg	if one walked slowly , between road and
p03-189-04.jpg	hospital .
p06-030-00.jpg	His mouth hardened , his eyes became
p06-030-01.jpg	steely . ' I see . ' Scorn lashed his

p06-030-07.jpg	badly - at any price . I hope
p06-030-08.jpg	you are satisfied . '
p06-042-00.jpg	And as he spoke , the thought
p06-042-01.jpg	of Philip lying in the other
p06-042-02.jpg	room filled him with a re-
p06-042-03.jpg	vulsion that was homicidal .
p06-042-04.jpg	Even in that , his hands were
p06-042-05.jpg	tied . He dare not precipitate
p06-042-06.jpg	what might well be another
p06-042-07.jpg	coronary . And in that second
p06-042-08.jpg	he put back his professional
p06-042-09.jpg	mantle , and said with such
p06-042-10.jpg	icy politeness , such withdrawn
p06-047-00.jpg	' I will leave you the necessary pre-
p06-047-01.jpg	scription for the sedatives . You
p06-047-02.jpg	will contact your new doctor

p06-047-06.jpg	waistcoat pocket , take out
p06-047-07.jpg	his # prescription pad , and
p06-047-08.jpg	# scribble on it . Then ,
p06-047-09.jpg	with a gesture she knew so well ,
p06-047-10.jpg	he tore off the leaflet and
p06-052-00.jpg	' Good-bye , Sandra , ' he said
p06-052-01.jpg	with a deadly finality . Watching
p06-052-02.jpg	him go , unable to speak , she
p06-052-03.jpg	felt that part of her was leaving
p06-052-04.jpg	him . She couldn't hate him ...
p06-052-05.jpg	If only he would have con-
p06-052-06.jpg	fided in her , given some expla-
p06-052-07.jpg	nation . Now there was no-
p06-052-08.jpg	thing - not even friendship .
p06-058-00.jpg	She went back to Philip . But
p06-058-01.jpg	all she could hear were Nicholas's

p06-058-03.jpg	know that well enough . '
p06-058-04.jpg	Love . She revolted against
p06-058-05.jpg	the word . Nicholas , Philip ...
p06-058-06.jpg	where was happiness , or
p06-058-07.jpg	peace of mind ? Philip put out
p06-058-08.jpg	a hand and grasped hers .
p06-058-09.jpg	He needed her . She would find
p06-058-10.jpg	solace in that fact at least .
p06-069-00.jpg	She had her truth . How much had built
p06-069-01.jpg	up from that first ideal , and how
p06-069-02.jpg	little joy , or satisfaction , it had
p06-069-03.jpg	given her . ' I'm sorry , darling . '
p06-069-04.jpg	He looked nervous . It had been
p06-069-05.jpg	hell lying there , knowing she was
p06-069-06.jpg	talking to Nicholas and wondering
p06-069-07.jpg	what they were saying . Sandra
p06-069-08.jpg	said instinctively : ' I told him
p06-069-09.jpg	I knew he was responsible for
p06-069-10.jpg	Beryl's death . '
p06-088-00.jpg	Her eyes darkened in torment . ' Are
p06-088-01.jpg	you sure that she was telling the truth ? '
p06-088-02.jpg	' Good heavens , darling , why on earth
p06-088-03.jpg	should she lie ? Besides , it wasn't just
p06-088-04.jpg	her word . There was enough evidence ,
p06-088-05.jpg	no matter how one might want to
p06-088-06.jpg	disbelieve the facts . ' Elation
p06-088-07.jpg	touched him after the cold wind
p06-088-08.jpg	of suspense . ' It will be interesting
p06-088-09.jpg	to see what comes out at the inquest .
p06-096-00.jpg	What his story will be . I reckon
p06-096-01.jpg	he'll confine himself to the nervous
p06-096-02.jpg	origin of her recent illness . His notes
p06-096-03.jpg	will be truthful , but what he leaves out
p06-096-04.jpg	will matter most . ' Strange how just
p06-096-05.jpg	then Philip was so certain that Nicholas
p06-096-06.jpg	would never betray him . He loved
p06-096-07.jpg	Sandra too deeply to ruin her
p06-096-08.jpg	future happiness . Had ever circum-
p06-096-09.jpg	stances conspired so cunningly ?
p06-096-10.jpg	Philip's spirits soared .
p06-104-00.jpg	He was better ; he had made a
p06-104-01.jpg	miraculous recovery and Sandra would
p06-104-02.jpg	soon be his wife . The Devil , he thought ,
p06-104-03.jpg	certainly looked after his own .
p06-104-04.jpg	Something in Sandra's attitude struck
p06-104-05.jpg	him suddenly , making him say :
p06-104-06.jpg	' You can't forgive him for this -
p06-104-07.jpg	can you ? ' ' Forgive is an unctuous ,
